With French and German\nelections due in 2017,there are fears centrist parties will lose more ground,\nbut few can explain why. ', u'In\nthis new two part documentary series,\xa0Croatian philosopher Sre\u0107ko Horvat looks\nbehind the refugee flows, terror attacks, and Brexit to reveal what is really\nthreatening Europe\u2019s establishment.', u'\u201cOften\nthese phenomena are discussed as if they are forces of nature beyond our control\u201d\nsays Sre\u0107ko. \u201cBut as a philosopher I look for the root causes. What if the\neconomic collapse, refugees and terrorism are actually all caused by something\nmore fundamental?\u201d', u'Starting\nin Idomeni, where the refugees crossed from Greece to Macedonia, Sre\u0107ko goes on\na pan-European odyssey that takes in the Port of Piraeus, Romanian Forests,\nWelsh valleys, the offices of far right parties, the channel tunnel and the\nEuropean Parliament. ', u'In the first episode, ', u'The Business of Colonisation', u', Sre\u0107ko finds evidence that the colonial methods of extraction and\ndemocratic suppression that European nations once applied to much of the Middle\nEast and Africa in the 19', u'th', u' and 20', u'th', u' centuries are now\nbeing practised on Europe itself. ', u'In an exclusive\nrevelation, former Greek Finance Minister ', u'Yanis\nVaroufakis', u' tells Al Jazeera how this undemocratic colonial control was used\nrecently to prevent Greece recovering from its debt crisis. As part of its bail\nout by the Troika of the European Central bank, European Commission and\nInternational Monetary Fund, Greece was forced to sell the strategic Port of\nPireaus. Varoufakis tells Sre\u0107ko how he\nnegotiated a deal with the Chinese that would guarantee jobs, investment and\nunion recognition, while the Chinese government would buy enough Greek\ngovernment bonds for them to return to international money markets. ', u'\u201cAnd guess what happened,\u201d\nsays Varoufakis, \u201cthere was a telephone call from Berlin to Beijing saying keep\noff Greece while we are negotiating with them and all deals were off because,\nof course, China is not going to jeopardise its relationship with the heart of\nEurope in order to seal a deal with us.\u201d', u'The\nsecond episode, ', u'The Colonised Society, ', u'Sre\u0107ko\nlooks at how the people of Europe are responding. \u201cThe\nmajor decisions that determine how life is lived are made without popular\nparticipation and that causes anger, frustration and contempt for the\nparliamentary system\u201d, says Professor ', u'Noam\nChomsky', u' \u201cAnd it leads to erratic and often frightening reactions.\u201d ', u'Sre\u0107ko examines how\nthose frightening reactions include terrorism and the rise of the far right, on\ntrips to Molenbeek in Brussels and to meet Hungarian nationalist party Jobbick\nin Budapest. But the anger and frustration at colonisation has also taken a\ndifferent route, as Sre\u0107ko finds out in visits to French protest camps, Greek\nmarkets, German energy grids, and the City of Barcelona. ', u'Across\ntwo 48 minute episodes, Sre\u0107ko talks to Welsh steel workers, French protesters,\nHungarian philosopher ', u'Agnes Heller', u', MEP ', u'Nigel Farage,\n', u'professor ', u'Noam Chomsky', u', philosopher\n', u'Slavoj Zizek', u', Socioloigist ', u'Saskia Sassen, ', u'Wikileaks founder ', u'Julian Assange', u', \xa0and the mayor of Barcelona ', u'Ada Colau', u'. Sre\u0107ko\u2019s journey across Europe is deadly serious,\nand his analysis urgent, but the films are also lifted by the irrepressible\ncharm and humour of one of Europe\u2019s leading young thinkers.
