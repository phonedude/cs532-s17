On a trip to her childhood home, she wonders: What (on earth) will she do next?_\\n\\nBY NOW YOU KNOW that the past few years have been extraordinary ones in the life of [Taylor Swift](http://www.vogue.com/tag/celebrity/taylor-swift). Even if you have only casual knowledge of Swift\u2019s music\u2014there may be six or seven souls left on the planet who can\u2019t sing all the words to \u201cShake It Off\u201d\u2014you\u2019re aware that Swift has become not only one of the most successful recording artists ever, but also an unrivaled power broker who has prevailed in a volatile media economy and brought today\u2019s music overlords to heel. [Swift\u2019s 2015 stare-down of Apple](http://www.vogue.com/13261887/taylor-swift-power-plays/)\u2014she declined to put her hit album [_1989_](http://www.vogue.com/3533441/taylor-swift-new-album-review-1989/) on Apple\u2019s nascent streaming-music service when the company said it would not pay artists during its initial launch; Apple changed its policy immediately and paid everyone\u2014was a seismic example of a single artist\u2019s toppling corporate might. At 26, Swift is world famous, wealthy, critically celebrated, a style influencer, and a cultural movement unto herself, recognizable everywhere she goes. She also has two awesome cats.\\n\\nAnd yet today, in this chapel atop a hill in Reading, Pennsylvania, Swift is none of those things. She is the [maid of honor at the wedding of her childhood friend Britany Maack](http://www.vogue.com/13404316/weddings-taylor-swift-maid-of-honor-best-friend-wedding/). Swift and Maack have known each other since Swift was ten days old and have stayed close\u2014there are grainy home videos of the two romping around a crib together and, more recently, photos of them sitting side by side at the 2014 [Grammys](http://www.vogue.com/tag/event/grammy-awards). Last spring, after Swift accepted Britany\u2019s invitation to be maid of honor via Instagram\u2014kids today!\u2014she took Maack to Reem Acra, where Britany got fitted for her custom hand-embroidered silk-taffeta wedding gown and Taylor for the blush-pink, cap-sleeved chiffon maid-of-honor dress that she has on today (the fitting was also Instagrammed, naturally). Swift has even known the groom, Benjamin LaManna, since kindergarten\u2014she admits to having had a little crush on Ben way back then, when he was \u201cthat kid who sat next to me in class with the bowl cut and the Lego lunch box.\u201d\\n\\n_Taylor Swift talks Googling herself, which celebrity\u2019s closet she\u2019d raid, and the bravest thing she\u2019s ever done:_\\n\\n[#cneembed: embedjs/57151c5794c05f016a00000c/5176e8c068f9dadeab00000f.js?autoplay=1&muted=1]||||||\\n\\n[_Get the May issue on Amazon._](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01DYPVQRI)\\n\\nSwift hasn\u2019t been to Reading in more than a decade; she was fourteen when she moved with her family to Nashville, on her way to becoming a celebrated country singer-songwriter and later blossoming into one of the biggest pop acts in music history. Returning to the place where you grew up can be a bit of a mind-bender for anyone, and Swift is no different. During a car ride earlier in the day, she excitedly pointed out landmarks: the creek where she and Britany used to play as kids; a weathered tree house in the front yard of the former Maack family home; the piney woods she and her friends used to think were haunted.\\n\\n\u201cIt\u2019s such a surreal, emotional thing,\u201d Swift says. \u201cWhen you\u2019re a little kid, you\u2019re riding the same roads to school every single day, hundreds of times. When you come back, you snap into that strange nostalgia.\u201d\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd the church! There are nuns here at Sacred Heart Chapel who taught Swift in kindergarten. Many of the wedding guests have known her for just as long. To them, Swift is not the superstar who, a handful of days ago, stood on a stage in Los Angeles and accepted a Grammy Award for Album of the Year, the first woman to win that prize twice. No, that maid of honor, currently fussing over and straightening out the train of the bride\u2019s gown, is Taylor\u2014Scott and Andrea Swift\u2019s older kid, Austin\u2019s big sister, who grew up barely a five-minute drive away and used to go for ice cream at the Friendly\u2019s down the street.\\n\\nTo be clear: I\u2019m not saying the people in this church aren\u2019t aware that Scott and Andrea\u2019s kid turned into, you know, _Taylor Freakin\u2019 Swift_\u2014it\u2019s hilarious to watch the flower girls try to keep it together, and the nuns seem pretty jazzed, too\u2014but that\u2019s not the story today. Britany and Ben are. And the only evidence that the maid of honor is you-know-who is the paparazzi who have gathered at the bottom of the hill, hoping to snag a photo with their long lenses.\\n\\n_Taylor Swift vs. Karlie Kloss\u2014Who\'s the best best friend?_\\n\\n[#cneembed: embedjs/54dd1f6561646d5f8a050000/5176e8c068f9dadeab00000f.js?autoplay=1&muted=1]||||||\\n\\nWE NEED TO TALK about the Christmas-tree farm.\\n\\nA treasured footnote to the Taylor Swift backstory is that she spent much of her childhood being raised at, of all places, a Christmas-tree nursery called Pine Ridge Farm. It is the kind of quaint, Norman Rockwell\u2013ian detail that sounds a bit too precious, too good to be true. Weren\u2019t her parents in finance? Didn\u2019t she grow up in the burbs? How was this possibly real? Come on.\\n\\nThe Christmas-tree farm is real. She showed me herself.\\n\\nIt\u2019s the morning of the wedding, and I am riding in an SUV with Swift and her mother, Andrea. Andrea is powering down the road, and Swift, dressed in a caramel-colored Reformation jacket and a pair of black jeans, is sitting passenger side. This area around Reading and its adjacent town, Wyomissing, is rich with pastoral roads marked by open fields and stone homes, and the kind of rolling countryside that makes you want to saddle up and ride a horse\u2014which Swift did as a child.\\n\\n\u201cThat was kind of my mom\u2019s thing,\u201d Taylor says. \u201cShe really wanted me to be a horseback rider, and I did it competitively until I worked up the nerve at age twelve to tell her I didn\u2019t really love it like she loved it.\\n\\n\u201cI just wanted to make music and do theater,\u201d she says. \u201cSo I\u2019ve been a big disappointment.\u201d\\n\\n\u201cI\u2019ve gotten over the bitterness, finally,\u201d Andrea says sarcastically.\\n\\n_Behind the scenes of Taylor Swift\u2019s first cover for_ Vogue_:_\\n\\n[#cneembed: embedjs/51716fcec2b4c00c18e540e9/5176e8c068f9dadeab00000f.js?autoplay=1&muted=1]||||||\\n\\nSoon we arrive at a clearing with a barn and a small farmhouse. This is the place, they tell me. Taylor and Andrea have not made any calls or arrangements about visiting. It\u2019s going to be a random drop-in from a pop star, like the Taylor Swift Publishers Clearing House Sweepstakes or something.\\n\\nTaylor notices a man stepping into his car in the driveway. We pull up alongside, and Andrea rolls down her window. Taylor leans over. \u201cI used to live here,\u201d she says brightly.\\n\\nThe man immediately gives what can only be described as a Holy crap\u2013it\u2019s\u2013Taylor Swift look. \u201cI know,\u201d he says, as if on cue.\\n\\nEveryone laughs. The man\u2019s name is Dave Schaeffer, and he has lived here with his wife, Debbie, for about six years. He invites us to have a look around, and we all pile out.\\n\\n\u201cThis must really bring back some memories,\u201d Dave says.\\n\\n\u201cYeah, this is crazy,\u201d Taylor says. She surveys the fields behind the driveway, which include a small grove of pine trees her parents once planted. They now look tall enough for Christmas at Rockefeller Center. \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful.\u201d\\n\\nThis is where, Andrea tells me, Taylor Swift was brought home from the hospital in, well, 1989\u2014I guess everyone knows the year of Taylor\u2019s birth by now. The split-rail fence that\u2019s still standing\u2014Scott and Andrea built that themselves. Scott, a stockbroker, actually purchased and lived on the property before he\u2019d met Andrea; on their first date, she came to a party he hosted in the farmhouse.\\n\\nDebbie comes outside and introduces herself. \u201cI always thought you might want to stop by,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I never wanted to bother you.\u201d The Schaeffers confess they lived here for a while before they learned about the famous former resident. \u201cThe pizza guy told us,\u201d Debbie says. \u201cWe had no idea.\u201d\\n\\nShe invites everyone inside. As we step into the cozy two-floor home, Taylor takes out her phone and starts filming. There\u2019s the living room where the Swifts put their family Christmas tree. There\u2019s where they once put the piano.\\n\\nCasey, Dave and Debbie\u2019s daughter, arrives. She actually owns the house with her husband and lives nearby. She\u2019s thrilled but also beside herself that her two daughters are away skiing for the day.\\n\\n\u201cYou want to see your room?\u201d Debbie asks Taylor.\\n\\nWe go upstairs into a small corner room where a tiny Taylor used to demand three books and five songs every night. Taylor gathers the family together to make a quick video for the Schaeffers\u2019 granddaughters, Siena and Tarah.\\n\\n\u201cHi, Siena and Tarah,\u201d Taylor says cheerily. \u201cThis used to be my room. We wish you were here so bad.\u201d\\n\\nI can\u2019t lie: All I can think of is Siena and Tarah returning from their ski trip to learn that Taylor Swift was hanging out at their grandparents\u2019 house, and deciding right then they will never go skiing ever again.\\n\\nOn the ride back, Andrea and Taylor sound almost overcome by what has just happened\u2014by the sweet and polite and utterly un\u2013freaked out mood of the whole experience. \u201cMy faith in humanity is restored,\u201d Taylor says.\\n\\nAnd then she turns her head quickly away from the window: paparazzi.\\n\\nYES: I SHOULD NOTE that when we arrived at the farm, we were informed by a couple of Swift\u2019s security people that there were at least a trio of uninvited photographers who had followed us to the location to catch some hot, sexy farm-visit action. To Swift, this is about as surprising as . . . what is the exact opposite of surprise? This is her constant state. She lives with it, adapts to it. Just a few years back, Swift was so excited about relocating to New York City\u2014it was the creative basis for _1989_\u2014but when she\u2019s in the city now, within a couple of days, there is a circus of photographers outside her apartment building.\\n\\n\u201cBut that kind of happens everywhere,\u201d she says. The wedding ceremony has finished\u2014Britany and Ben made it official to applause\u2014and Swift and I have huddled downstairs at the church during a break before the reception.\\n\\nI ask her: When was the last time you were in a place where nobody in the press had any idea you were there\u2014no reporters, no photographers?\\n\\n\u201cMmmm, Colorado\u2019s good,\u201d she says. \u201cIf I go somewhere and stay in a house, nobody knows.\u201d\\n\\nSwift says she is ready to lie a little low. After the wedding, she will go to New York, where she will be spotted dining with her friend [Lena Dunham](http://www.vogue.com/tag/celebrity/lena-dunham), and then be seen a week later in Los Angeles with her brother, Austin, and her friend [Lorde](http://www.vogue.com/tag/celebrity/lorde) at the _Vanity Fair_ Oscar Party. As for future plans . . . who knows? For the first time in years, Swift is not sure exactly what is next. She is very much OK with this.\\n\\n_So what the hell are you going to do with the rest of your life, Taylor Swift?_\\n\\n\u201cI have no idea,\u201d she says, with a sigh that\u2019s more blissful than anxious. \u201cThis is the first time in ten years that I haven\u2019t known. I just decided that after the past year, with all of the unbelievable things that happened . . . I decided I was going to live my life a little bit without the pressure on myself to create something.\u201d\\n\\nDo not freak: Swift is not abandoning making music. Those who know her know this is chemically impossible. (\u201cHer not being creative is one of the last things I\u2019d ever worry about,\u201d the musician and producer Jack Antonoff tells me later.)\\n\\n\u201cI\u2019m always going to be writing songs,\u201d Swift says. \u201cThe thing is, with me, I could very well come up with three things in the next two weeks and then jump back into the studio, and all of a sudden the next record is started. That\u2019s an option, too.\u201d\\n\\nBut probably not for the moment. \u201cI would really like to take a little time to learn things,\u201d Swift says. \u201cI have lots of short-term goals.\u201d\\n\\n_Such as?_\\n\\n\u201cI want to be a well-rounded person who can make a good drink.\u201d (I can confirm from the wedding\u2019s cocktail gathering that Taylor Swift enjoys an Old Fashioned and knows how to make one.)\\n\\n_Anything else?_\\n\\n\u201cTo be able to save somebody if they\u2019re drowning,\u201d she says. She\u2019s completely serious. \u201cSo CPR, all the various kinds of chest compressions. People tell you little tips, but that\u2019s different from actually taking a class and getting certified.\u201d\\n\\n_Can you change a tire?_\\n\\n\u201cNo. I should probably know how to do that.\\n\\n\u201cI do things like this,\u201d Swift says. Once, \u201cI got it in my head that I couldn\u2019t do a split, and I was really upset about it. And so I stretched every single day for a year until I could do a split. Somehow I feel better knowing that I can.\u201d\\n\\nI ask her if she\u2019d ever consider launching a fashion line.\\n\\n\u201cTheoretically, yes,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I would want it to be something that was relatable and accessible and everyday. I don\u2019t see it being couture. I would want it to be reflective of my style. And a lot of things I wear are not highly expensive.\u201d\\n\\nIn May, Swift will cochair the [Metropolitan Museum of Art Costume Institute\u2019s 2016 gala](http://www.vogue.com/tag/event/met-gala), for the exhibition \u201c[Manus x Machina: Fashion in an Age of Technology](http://www.vogue.com/13400049/metropolitan-museum-of-art-manus-x-machina-exhibit-book/).\u201d It is a topic Swift\u2014easily one of the biggest style icons of the social-media era\u2014understands better than most, from technology\u2019s ability to shape trends to its growing influence on creativity and design.\\n\\nSwift\u2019s personal style has, not surprisingly, matured over the course of her career, migrating from the early days of sundresses and, as she describes them, \u201cbedazzled cowboy boots\u201d to the vintage fifties vibe of a few years ago to the sleeker, street-conscious look she favors now. \u201cI can look back at an old photo and tell you roughly what year it\u2019s from,\u201d Swift says. \u201cGoing through different phases is one of my favorite things about fashion. I love how it can mark the passage of time. It\u2019s similar to my songs in that way\u2014it all helps identify where I was at in different points of my life.\u201d\\n\\n+++large\\n> There are a lot of really easy ways to dispel rumors. If they say you have fake friendships, all you have to do is continue to be there for each other\\n\\n\\n+++\\n\\nHer style has never been deliberately provocative or fad-chasing\u2014on the contrary, there\u2019s always been a kind of effortless appropriateness to Swift, a quality she shares with her friend the Midwest-raised model [Karlie Kloss](http://www.vogue.com/tag/model/karlie-kloss/)\u2014and yet it\u2019s easy to see a curiosity about new things. Recently Swift cut her hair into a sharp bob, and she\u2019s been seen strutting in a pair of Gothy, over-the-ankle Vetements boots that look stolen from the closet of Siouxsie Sioux. As usual, the changes are small, recognizable\u2014a genius of Swift\u2019s, from music to everything else, is experimentation without alienation. Swift\u2019s style never tries too hard or appears publicity-craving; everyone\u2019s already paying attention, anyway.\\n\\nBecause I\u2019m a hopeless cheeseball, I can\u2019t help asking: Being part of this wedding, does it make Swift think about being married some day? For the past year, she has been seeing the Scottish DJ-producer Calvin Harris. Harris is not here with her, but in early March, he and Swift will post cutesy notices on social media\u2014his on Snapchat; hers on Instagram\u2014commemorating the one-year status of their relationship. Soon after, [both will post photographs of an idyllic, whereabouts-unknown vacation in the tropics](http://www.vogue.com/13416553/travel-calvin-harris-taylor-swift-anniversary-vacation-beach/), with ts + aw written in the sand. (Harris\u2019s given name is Adam Wiles.)\\n\\n\u201cI\u2019m just taking things as they come,\u201d Swift says. \u201cI\u2019m in a magical relationship right now. And of course I want it to be ours, and low-key . . . this is the one thing that\u2019s been mine about my personal life.\u201d\\n\\nSwift\u2019s friend Lorde thinks that Swift can only withdraw from music for so long. \u201cWe talk about this\u2014in order to do good work, write these deeply personal records, we\u2019re constantly in a place of metacognition. Sometimes it can feel like you\u2019re a scholar writing a thesis about your own brain,\u201d Lorde says. \u201cSo I think she\u2019s going to try to pick up some new skills, maybe take courses in something. Tay is a big fan of taking time off until about month two\u2014and then she gets this look in her eyes, and I know all the _Dateline_ and frozen yogurt and mooching around is about to go out the window.\u201d\\n\\nHere on a basement floor of the country club, where the bride is adjusting her gown, Swift and I hear the cocktail party gaining steam. A pair of bridesmaids stroll by. Swift gives them high fives.\\n\\n\u201cHonestly, I never relax, and I\u2019m excited about being able to relax for the first time in ten years,\u201d she says.\\n\\nSwift takes a sip of her Old Fashioned. \u201cI feel relaxed right now.\u201d\\n\\nJUST A FEW DAYS before, Swift had been in the thick of it. In her Grammy acceptance speech for Album of the Year, she\u2019d offered stirring words to women in the audience, but also made what was presumed to be a less-than-veiled reply to [Kanye West](http://www.vogue.com/tag/celebrity/kanye-west), who\u2019d released a new song in which he\u2019d bragged he\u2019d made Swift famous and tackily theorized the pair would one day have sex. The story pinged around on social media for the next 72 hours and generally made me want to put a metal pail on my head and bang it loudly against a wall.\\n\\nHadn\u2019t this whole Kanye vs. Taylor nonsense\u2014which began, of course, seven years ago, when West barged into Swift\u2019s MTV Video Music Awards acceptance speech to argue that [Beyonc\xe9](http://www.vogue.com/tag/celebrity/beyonce) should have won\u2014been declared over? Taylor Nation was aghast. Austin Swift posted an Instagram video in which he casually tossed a pair of West\u2019s Adidas Yeezy sneakers into the garbage.\\n\\nI tell Swift the whole thing reminded me of Al Pacino\u2019s famous line as the aging Mafia don Michael Corleone in _The Godfather Part III_.\\n\\n_\u201c \u2018I thought I was out . . .\u2019 \u201d_\\n\\nSwift knows exactly where I am going and finishes it: _\u201c \u2018They pull me back in!\u2019 \u201d_\\n\\n\u201cI think the world is so bored with the saga,\u201d she goes on. \u201cI don\u2019t want to add anything to it, because then there\u2019s just more.\u201d\\n\\nI get why Swift would not want to fuel the dispute, but it\u2019s not hard to see a connection between West\u2019s credit-taking and the long tradition of men being dismissive\u2014actively as well as subconsciously mansplainy\u2014of the hard work and success of women. This is something Swift has become hardened to, having spent much of her early years being mainly recognized not for her songwriting gifts (which just about everyone now agrees are rare and special) but for who she was dating, her fame distilled into what Swift calls \u201cmy incredibly sexist Men\u2013of\u2013Taylor Swift slideshows.\u201d\\n\\n\u201cYou know, I went out on a normal amount of dates in my early 20s, and I got absolutely slaughtered for it,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd it took a lot of hard work and altering my decision-making. I didn\u2019t date for two and a half years. Should I have had to do that? No.\\n\\n\u201cI guess what I wanted to call attention to in my speech at the Grammys was how it\u2019s going to be difficult if you\u2019re a woman who wants to achieve something in her life\u2014no matter what,\u201d she adds.\\n\\nThe day after the awards, Swift went shopping at [Barneys in Beverly Hills](http://www.vogue.com/city-directory/9351479/barneys-new-york-beverly-hills-store-los-angeles/)\u2014\u201cI was like, \u2018I\u2019m going to buy some nice shoes today\u2019 \u201d\u2014and says she was approached by a number of women, mothers in particular, who thanked her. \u201cTheir response was really beautiful. You never know what anyone\u2019s response is going to be. So when it\u2019s good, it\u2019s really nice.\u201d\\n\\nSwift has reached a level of fame at which unsolicited drama just finds her. The Men\u2013of\u2013Taylor Swift slideshows have calmed down, but she now takes grief for her \u201csquad\u201d of celebrity female friends, who, depending on the jab, are either too glam or too phony or some combination of the two.\\n\\n\u201cUgh,\u201d Swift says when I bring it up. \u201cI\u2019ve had people say really hurtful things about me, and so I\u2019ve kind of learned how to gauge it: \u2018This is, like, low-to-medium-level hurtful.\u2019\\n\\n\u201cThere are a lot of really easy ways to dispel rumors,\u201d she explains. \u201cIf they say you are pregnant, all you have to do is continue to not be pregnant and not have a baby. If the rumor is that you have fake friendships, all you have to do is continue to be there for each other. And when we\u2019re all friends in fifteen years and raising our kids together, maybe somebody will look back and go, \u2018That was kind of ridiculous what we said about Taylor and her friends.\u2019 \u201d\\n\\nIt\u2019s as if Swift has become so big, so enticing a target, that she is no longer a mere person but a cultural symbol from which anything can be demanded. Jack Antonoff describes Swift\u2019s status as \u201calmost like being president.\u201d He adds, \u201cShe\u2019s the biggest, but a lot of people have been the biggest. Not a lot of people have been the biggest and the best, and she is.\u201d\\n\\nAll of that feels a million light-years away, here, back home, among friends, at Britany\u2019s wedding. Before we part, Swift makes a request: She needs to practice her maid-of-honor speech. Now.\\n\\nAnd so, in a basement corridor at the country club, Swift recites her maid-of-honor speech, which she has memorized.\\n\\nI don\u2019t have to tell you that Taylor Swift\u2019s maid-of-honor speech is great. Of course it\u2019s great.\\n\\nHERE\'S ONE OTHER THING about this wedding: Brit\xadany and Ben made the brilliant decision, which apparently is becoming a bit of a thing with twenty-first-century nuptials, to politely ask their guests to not bring their phones. So from the ceremony to the receptions and the toasts, people actually paid attention to the bride and groom\u2014they focused, laughed, existed in the now. \u201cAll of our guests were present,\u201d Britany tells me later. \u201cI truly attribute this to everyone unplugging from distractions and enjoying the moment.\u201d\\n\\nWhen the time comes, Swift grabs the mic and delivers her maid-of-honor address with the unperturbed calm of someone who does this kind of thing before 50,000 people. She tells the story of having a crush on kindergarten-era Ben with his bowl cut and Lego lunch box. She talks about how, as toddlers, Britany was the physical one, and she was the verbal one. \u201cEssentially what you had were these two babies who each made up for what the other lacked,\u201d Swift says. \u201cOne couldn\u2019t really walk. One couldn\u2019t really talk. And interestingly enough, we assume those exact personas to this day when we are drunk . . . give us an hour.\u201d\\n\\nThe room goes crazy.\\n\\nA few beats later, Swift has everyone teary when she talks about the \u201creal love\u201d she sees between Britany and Ben. \u201cReal love doesn\u2019t mess with your head,\u201d she says. \u201cReal love just is. Real love just endures. Real love maintains. Real love takes it page by page.\u201d\\n\\n(I told you it was a good speech.)\\n\\nLater on, there will be cake. Later on, there will be dancing, those flower girls getting a story that is going to totally blow their classmates\u2019 minds at school on Monday. Later on, the wedding band will entice Swift to the stage, where she will sing \u201cShake It Off\u201d for her childhood friend on her wedding night and an audience that for the first time in history isn\u2019t waving 10,000 smartphones in her face. The night\u2014the whole weekend\u2014is storybook warm. You know the old Thomas Wolfe novel _You Can\u2019t Go Home Again_? Sometimes it\u2019s really true.\\n\\nBut Taylor Swift did.\\n\\n[#cneembed:
