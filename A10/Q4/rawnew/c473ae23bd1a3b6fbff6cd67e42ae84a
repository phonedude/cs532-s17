One indigenous tribe in central India reported essentially none. And the discs in their backs ', u'showed', u' little signs of degeneration as people aged.', u' ', u"An acupuncturist in Palo Alto, Calif., thinks she has figured out why. She has traveled around the world studying cultures with low rates of back pain \u2014 how they stand, sit and walk. Now she's sharing their secrets with back pain sufferers across the U.S.", u' ', u'About two decades ago, ', u'Esther Gokhale', u' started to struggle with her own back after she had her first child. "I had excruciating pain. I couldn\'t sleep at night," she says. "I was walking around the block every two hours. I was just crippled."', u' ', u'Gokhale had a herniated disc. Eventually she had surgery to fix it. But a year later, it happened again. "They wanted to do another back surgery. You don\'t want to make a habit out of back surgery," she says.', u' ', u'This time around, Gokhale wanted to find a permanent fix for her back. And she wasn\'t convinced Western medicine could do that. So Gokhale started to think outside the box. She had an idea: "Go to populations where they don\'t have these huge problems and see what they\'re doing."', u' ', u'\n', u'\n', u' ', u'\n', u'\n', u' ', u'\n', u"Esther Gokhale's Five Tips For Better Posture And Less Back Pain", u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u"Try these exercises while you're working at your desk, sitting at the dinner table or walking around, Esther Gokhale recommends.", u' ', u'1. Do a shoulder roll', u': Americans tend to scrunch their shoulders forward, so our arms are in front of our bodies. That\'s not how people in indigenous cultures carry their arms, Gokhale says. To fix that, gently pull your shoulders up, push them back and then let them drop \u2014 like a shoulder roll. Now your arms should dangle by your side, with your thumbs pointing out. "This is the way all your ancestors parked their shoulders," she says. "This is the natural architecture for our species."', u' ', u'2. Lengthen your spine:', u' Adding extra length to your spine is easy, Gokhale says. Being careful not to arch your back, take a deep breath in and grow tall. Then maintain that height as you exhale. Repeat: Breathe in, grow even taller and maintain that new height as you exhale. "It takes some effort, but it really strengthens your abdominal muscles," Gokhale says.', u' ', u'3. Squeeze, squeeze your glute muscles when you walk:', u' In many indigenous cultures, people squeeze their gluteus medius muscles every time they take a step. That\'s one reason they have such shapely buttocks muscles that support their lower backs. Gokhale says you can start developing the same type of derri\xe8re by tightening the buttocks muscles when you take each step. "The gluteus medius is the one you\'re after here. It\'s the one high up on your bum," Gokhale says. "It\'s the muscle that keeps you perky, at any age."', u' ', u"4. Don't put your chin up", u': Instead, add length to your neck by taking a lightweight object, like a bean bag or folded washcloth, and balance it on the top of your crown. Try to push your head against the object. "This will lengthen the back of your neck and allow your chin to angle down \u2014 not in an exaggerated way, but in a relaxed manner," Gokhale says.', u' ', u"5. Don't sit up straight!", u' "That\'s just arching your back and getting you into all sorts of trouble," Gokhale says. Instead do a shoulder roll to open up the chest and take a deep breath to stretch and lengthen the spine.', u'\n', u'\n', u' END CLASS="BUCKET" ', u'\n', u'\n', u' END ID="RES412784933" CLASS="BUCKETWRAP LISTTEXT" ', u'\n', u'\n', u' END CLASS="CONTAINER SMALL" ID="CON412787013" PREVIEWTITLE="TIPS" ', u'\n', u'[Added June 10]', u' So Gokhale studied findings from anthropologists, such as ', u'Noelle Perez-Christiaens', u', who analyzed postures of indigenous populations.

She went to the mountains in Ecuador, tiny fishing towns in Portugal and remote villages of West Africa.', u' ', u'"I went to villages where every kid under age 4 was crying because they were frightened to see somebody with white skin \u2014 they\'d never seen a white person before," she says.', u' ', u'Gokhale took photos and videos of people who walked with water buckets on their heads, collected firewood or sat on the ground weaving, for hours.', u' ', u'"I have a picture in my book of these two women who spend seven to nine hours everyday, bent over, gathering water chestnuts," Gokhale says. "They\'re quite old. But the truth is they don\'t have a back pain."', u' ', u'She tried to figure out what all these different people had in common. The first thing that popped out was the shape of their spines. "They have this regal posture, and it\'s very compelling."', u' ', u"And it's quite different than American spines.", u' ', u"If you look at an American's spine from the side, or profile, it's shaped like the letter S. It curves at the top and then back again at the bottom.", u' ', u'But Gokhale didn\'t see those two big curves in people who don\'t have back pain. "That S shape is actually not natural," she says. "It\'s a J-shaped spine that you want."', u' ', u'In fact, if you look at drawings from Leonardo da Vinci \u2014 or a ', u"Gray's Anatomy", u" book from 1901 \u2014 the spine isn't shaped like a sharp, curvy S.
