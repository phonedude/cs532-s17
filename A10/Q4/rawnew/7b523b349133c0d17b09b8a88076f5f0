', u'\u201c[President Temer] is obviously an illegitimate president of Brazil,\u201d Rousseff told \u2018UpFront\u2019 host Mehdi Hasan. \u201cBecause the process which brought him to government\u2026is a process based on tearing up the Brazilian constitution.\u201d ', u'\u201cI never expected him to be a traitor and he is a traitor,\u201d she added. \u201cHe didn\u2019t betray me as the person Dilma Rousseff, he rather betrayed the President of the Republic. He betrayed an institution. And furthermore, he betrayed a campaign.\u201d ', u'During the interview, Rousseff addressed the allegations that led to her impeachment. ', u'\u201cThe parliament allied itself with segments of the judiciary system and launched a coup d\u2019\xe9tat, removing a president from office, with completely unsubstantiated allegations,\u201d she said. ', u'Rousseff said her experience is not unique and a global phenomenon.', u'\u201cWhat is happening in the world, especially here in Latin America, but elsewhere in the world too, is a process of parliamentary coup, or institutional coup, through which a branch of power forms alliances, with the omission of other segments of power,\u201d she said. ', u'On the issue of the Petrobras scandal, which implicated numerous Brazilian politicians, she denied any knowledge of corruption inside the oil company. Before assuming the presidency, Rousseff was Chairman of Petrobras, Brazil\u2019s biggest company, between 2003 and 2010.', u'\u201cThe council, which I was a member of, included businessmen,\u201d she said. \u201cNone of us detected anything, funnily enough, there is no council where the Chair is the only person who is held accountable. Why are none of the major businessman questioned? Why only me?\u201d', u'\u201cBecause there is a huge difference between being a member of the Council and being a member of the Board of Petrobras,\u201d she added. \u201cThis difference exists in every organization. The prosecutors from Opera\xe7\xe3o Lava Jato (Operation Car Wash) acknowledged that corruption happens in the dark.\u201d ', u'Rousseff also called upon the Brazilian government to conduct fresh elections and not wait until 2018. ', u'\u201cI believe that the key component in the ongoing struggle in Brazil today is a return of free elections for president,\u201d she said. \u201cWe must elect a new president of the Republic so that this coup is effectively blocked.\u201d', u'ENDS', u'Note to Editors', u'\u2022\tThis \u2018UpFront\u2019 interview with Dilma Rousseff airs Friday December 16th at 19:30GMT.', u'\u2022\tThe full show will be available through this link: ', u'www.aljazeera.com/upfront', u' from 19:30GMT onwards.', u'\u2022\tIf using quotes please credit Al Jazeera English and \u2018UpFront\u2019 and please add this link to online copy ', u'www.aljazeera.com/upfront', u'\u2022\tFollow \u2018UpFront\u2019 on Twitter@AJUpFront', u'\u2022\tFor more information, or media enquiries, please contact: pressoffice@aljazeera.net', u'AlJazeera', u'AJUpFront', u'Brazil', u'Read more', u' post-content ', u' .post ', u' START NOTES ', u'marcelineabadeerr', u' liked this                                    ', u'vaulted-eel', u' liked this                                    ', u'aljazeerapr', u' posted this                                                                        ', u' END NOTES ', u' #content ', u' .inner ', u' #container ', u'Facebook', u'Twitter', u'About', u"The Public Relations team at Al Jazeera sharing what's new and exclusive.", u'\n                    function recent_tweets(data) { window.tweets_data = data; }\n                ', u'People I follow', u' #sidebar ', u' #main-border ', u' #main ', u'Al Jazeera PR', u'Home', u'About', u'Awards', u'Contact Us', u'Archive', u'\xa9 Copyright Al Jazeera 2012\u20132017', u' #footer ', u' #wrapper ', u'\n']
