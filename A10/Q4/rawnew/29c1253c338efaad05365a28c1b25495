After fulfilling her contract with Def Jam, she created her own imprint, Westbury Road Entertainment, on Universal\u2019s Roc Nation label. In a bold move, she then acquired the masters of all her previous albums and made a reported $25 million promotional deal with Samsung. Robyn Rihanna Fenty, the island girl plucked from obscurity at sixteen by a posse of music moguls, is becoming one herself. It\u2019s because she\u2019s so attuned to the seismic changes in her industry that she also bought a share of Tidal. \u201cStreaming counts now,\u201d she says. Like any savvy businesswoman, Rihanna knows it\u2019s important to diversify. Last fall, she announced a new venture, Fr8me, an agency representing stylists and hair and makeup artists.

Directed by Luc Besson, it costars Dane DeHaan and Delevingne and is due out in 2017. Speaking by phone, Besson is reluctant to give too much away about her character, except to say that her personality changes \u201cevery fifteen seconds.\u201d \u201cAs you can imagine, because she\u2019s number one in her business, she has a protection, like a crocodile,\u201d the director says of Rihanna. \u201cBut she really let herself go. I was so touched by her.\u201d', u' /react-text ', u' react-text: 274 ', u'Earlier at the house, two men in suits arrived from the Recording Industry Association of America to present Rihanna with two plaques: one certifying ', u' /react-text ', u' react-text: 276 ', u'Anti', u' /react-text ', u' react-text: 277 ', u'\u2019s platinum status, the other commemorating a benchmark she reached last July, when she became the first artist in history to reach 100 million downloads online.

Rihanna seems genuinely surprised by the accolades. \u201cIn flats and sweats!\u201d she says, stretching out a leg. \u201cIf only I knew they were coming, I would\u2019ve at least put on a cute little thing.\u201d', u' /react-text ', u' react-text: 284 ', u'With the sudden release of \u201cFormation\u201d during ', u' /react-text ', u' react-text: 286 ', u'Anti', u' /react-text ', u' react-text: 287 ', u'\u2019s week of ascendance up the charts, it\u2019s no wonder the Internet is pitting Beyonc\xe9 and Rihanna against each other.

The 28-year-old singer appears in the doorway, fresh off a plane from Toronto, where the night before she and Drake wrapped the video for their hit single \u201cWork.\u201d She is wearing a vintage Guess leather biker jacket, a gray Star Wars T-shirt, and green Vetements sweatpants, her sleek black hair chopped into a blunt nineties bob. Even such a Netflix-and-chill look cannot conceal the singular proportions of her body. She hugs me hello and then floats upstairs, where hair and makeup stylists await.\\n\\nI settle into a chair outside and pass the time by\u2014what else?\u2014checking my phone. Thanks to the demands of the 24-hour news cycle, every Instagram post by a pop star has become a source of intrigue, every teased video clip fodder for frenzied speculation. On this particular afternoon, the RiRi chatter, robust on any day, is reaching peak hysteria.\\n\\n_Kendall Jenner, Cara Delevingne, and more of Rihanna\u2019s Navy pay tribute to \u201cWork\u201d:_\\n\\n[#cneembed: embedjs/56eabc9294c05f58d7000002/5176e8c068f9dadeab00000f.js?autoplay=1&muted=1]||||||\\n\\nTen days earlier, [Rihanna](http://www.vogue.com/tag/celebrity/rihanna) dropped [_Anti_](http://www.vogue.com/13393177/rihanna-anti-review/), her first album since 2012. For seven years, she had released a new pop confection every year, like clockwork. Then, suddenly, nothing. It wasn\u2019t just the timing. _Anti_ immediately announced itself as something different. A defiant, idiosyncratic mix of dance hall, doo-wop, and soul, it did not deliver her usual instantly gratifying, reliable pop formula. Stoking the fire were rumors that _Anti_ was leaked through Tidal, the streaming service run by [Jay Z](http://www.vogue.com/tag/celebrity/jay-z) and co-owned by Rihanna. Next were the reports of impossibly low sales figures. Then, the day before, out of nowhere, came the surprise release of [Beyonc\xe9](http://www.vogue.com/tag/celebrity/beyonce)\u2019s pointedly political video for \u201c[Formation](http://www.vogue.com/13396069/beyonce-music-video-givenchy-gucci-miu-miu/).\u201d The Internet is ablaze: _Did Bey just try to steal RiRi\u2019s thunder?_ And, most breathlessly: _Is Rihanna going to make a surprise appearance at the Super Bowl?!_\\n\\nRihanna, meanwhile, is reclining on a chaise on a veranda in the sun, taking pulls from a joint and sending wisps of smoke into the cloudless California sky. She\u2019s listening to a remix of Sia\u2019s \u201cChandelier,\u201d occasionally belting out a lyric in that inimitable Bajan tone: \u201cI\u2019m gonna live like tomorrow doesn\u2019t exist! Like it doesn\u2019t exist!\u201d\\n\\n[#image: /photos/589175fb7edfa70512d64920]||||||\\n\\n\\nWE ARE LIVING in a golden age of pop divas. Beyonc\xe9, [Taylor Swift](http://www.vogue.com/tag/celebrity/taylor-swift), [Adele](http://www.vogue.com/tag/celebrity/adele): Rarely have the top ranks been so ruled by women. We feel vulnerable with Adele, empowered by Taylor. We want to watch Beyonc\xe9. Watch her dance, watch her dominate the marketplace, watch her _slay_. In this gloriously crowded arena, Rihanna transmits something unique. Not afraid to show us her flaws, Rihanna inspires us to, as her friend [Cara Delevingne](http://www.vogue.com/tag/model/cara-delevingne) puts it, \u201cgo with your instinct and go with your gut, and if people don\u2019t like you, fuck \u2019em.\u201d\\n\\nThis take-it-or-leave-it realness is what draws young women into the ranks of Rihanna\u2019s fiercely loyal fan base, known as her Navy, after a lyric from her song \u201cG4L.\u201d And in 2016, the Navy is going to get a lot of Rihanna.\\n\\nOver the next few weeks alone, her plan is to fly to New York to debut [a collection](http://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/fall-2016-ready-to-wear/fenty-puma) she designed for Puma at New York Fashion Week; return to L.A. for the [Grammys](http://www.vogue.com/tag/event/grammy-awards); then head to London to perform at the Brit Awards (she will grind with Drake in white-hot fringed pants); and, two days after that, go back to California to begin a 63-city world tour. Her looks on tour are \u201cinspired by neutral earth tones,\u201d she says, \u201cand evolve from one extreme to the other as the show progresses.\u201d Joining her will be Big Sean and the Weeknd in Europe, as well as Travis Scott, whom she\u2019s been seen out with in the last few months. \u201cI like to bring people who can get the crowd excited,\u201d she says.\\n\\n\u201cI probably am going to have like four days of tour rehearsal in total, which is Freaking. Me. Out,\u201d Rihanna says. It\u2019s after 9:00 p.m., the shoot is over, and we\u2019re sitting cross-legged in red leather recliners in the home theater of the Beverly Hills house, sipping Pinot Grigio from Dixie cups. \u201cMy schedule is so crazy right now.\u201d It\u2019s why, she says, she\u2019s single: \u201cIt\u2019s definitely going to be a challenge when I do decide to pursue a relationship . . . but I have hope!\u201d Exercise is also hard to find time for. \u201cI don\u2019t work out as much as I\u2019d like to,\u201d she says, \u201cbut my trainer Jamie is a beast and she makes me pay for it.\u201d\\n\\nAfter her last tour, in 2013, for _Unapologetic_, Rihanna vowed to take a break from recording. \u201cI wanted to have a year to just do whatever I want artistically, creatively,\u201d she says. \u201cI lasted a week.\u201d The paparazzi got a picture of her going into the studio, \u201cand my fans were like, \u2018Oh, yes! We\u2019s droppin\u2019 a single.\u2019 \u201d From that moment, she says, the Navy was expecting an album. It would be another two years.\\n\\nTurns out it takes a while to reinvent your sound. As Delevingne says, \u201c_Anti_\u2019s got its own genre, and that genre is _her_.\u201d Had Rihanna gotten bored with the pop formula? \u201cVery much,\u201d the singer says. \u201cI just gravitated toward the songs that were honest to where I\u2019m at right now.\u201d From the first song, \u201cConsideration,\u201d a trip-hop collaboration with SZA, the message is clear. The chorus has Rihanna singing, \u201cI got to do things my own way, darling.\u201d It\u2019s \u201clike a PSA,\u201d she tells me. She recognizes the risks: \u201cIt might not be some automatic record that will be Top 40. But I felt like I earned the right to do that now.\u201d\\n\\n+++inset-left\\n[#image: /photos/589175fd85b3959618474265]||||||\\n+++\\nAvoiding the bravado and easy hooks of past hits, another song, \u201cHigher,\u201d reveals a woman who\u2019s been burned by love. Rihanna compares it to \u201ca drunk voice mail.\u201d She explains, \u201cYou know he\u2019s wrong, and then you get drunk and you\u2019re like, \u2018I could forgive him. I could call him. I could make up with him.\u2019 Just, desperate.\u201d The candor is heightened by a husky, soul-inflected warmth. \u201cWe just said, \u2018You know what? Let\u2019s just drink some whiskey and record this song.\u2019 \u201d\\n\\nThen there\u2019s \u201c[Work](http://www.vogue.com/13392435/rihanna-drake-work-new-song/),\u201d on which she repeats the word _work_ until it is no longer recognizable, a flourish one critic called \u201cpost-language.\u201d While it evokes a technofuture, it\u2019s actually a nod to her home culture in Barbados. (Though Rihanna now splits her time between New York and L.A., her ties to the island remain strong. She is close with her mother, Monica Braithwaite, who owns a clothing boutique there, and with her maternal grandfather, Lionel Braithwaite, a frequent star of her Instagram feed.) \u201cYou get what I\u2019m saying, but it\u2019s not all the way perfect,\u201d she says. \u201cBecause that\u2019s how we speak in the Caribbean.\u201d In the accompanying video she made with Drake\u2014\u201cEverything he does is so amazing\u201d\u2014Rihanna grinds and jerks in a knitted Rasta-colored [Tommy Hilfiger dress](http://www.vogue.com/13404737/rihanna-drake-tommy-hilfiger-jamaica-dancehall-queen/) at a raucous dance-hall party, the kind \u201cwe would go to in the Caribbean and just dance and drink and smoke and flirt,\u201d with her real-life best friends, Melissa Forde and Jennifer Rosales.\\n\\nThere have been a few singles dropped along the way, including \u201c[FourFiveSeconds](http://www.vogue.com/9658995/rihanna-kanye-west-fourfiveseconds-grammys-tour-video/),\u201d an acoustic collaboration with [Kanye West](http://www.vogue.com/tag/celebrity/kanye-west) and Paul McCartney. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like no one ever told him about his success,\u201d Rihanna says of McCartney, whom she found to be endearingly humble. \u201cIt\u2019s like, Aren\u2019t you busy being a Beatle?\u201d Last spring brought \u201c[Bitch Better Have My Money](http://www.vogue.com/13277700/rihanna-bbhmm-music-video/),\u201d an over-the-top revenge fantasy whose video walked the line between empowerment and misogyny. \u201cIt\u2019s just a way to describe a situation,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a way to be in charge, to let people know that you\u2019re all about your business.\u201d\\n\\nOver the past two years, Rihanna has definitely been all about her business. After fulfilling her contract with Def Jam, she created her own imprint, Westbury Road Entertainment, on Universal\u2019s Roc Nation label. In a bold move, she then acquired the masters of all her previous albums and made a reported $25 million promotional deal with Samsung. Robyn Rihanna Fenty, the island girl plucked from obscurity at sixteen by a posse of music moguls, is becoming one herself. It\u2019s because she\u2019s so attuned to the seismic changes in her industry that she also bought a share of Tidal. \u201cStreaming counts now,\u201d she says. Like any savvy businesswoman, Rihanna knows it\u2019s important to diversify. Last fall, she announced a new venture, Fr8me, an agency representing stylists and hair and makeup artists. She has a passionate interest in beauty and often scouts her own talent on Instagram.\\n\\nIn the midst of all this, she somehow found time to take a role in _Val\xe9rian and the City of a Thousand Planets_, a film based on a French comic series. Directed by Luc Besson, it costars Dane DeHaan and Delevingne and is due out in 2017. Speaking by phone, Besson is reluctant to give too much away about her character, except to say that her personality changes \u201cevery fifteen seconds.\u201d \u201cAs you can imagine, because she\u2019s number one in her business, she has a protection, like a crocodile,\u201d the director says of Rihanna. \u201cBut she really let herself go. I was so touched by her.\u201d\\n\\nEarlier at the house, two men in suits arrived from the Recording Industry Association of America to present Rihanna with two plaques: one certifying _Anti_\u2019s platinum status, the other commemorating a benchmark she reached last July, when she became the first artist in history to reach 100 million downloads online. (In another sign of the turbulent state of the music industry, reports will later cast doubt on _Anti_\u2019s platinum status, pointing out that the RIAA took into account one million giveaways that were part of the Samsung deal.) Rihanna seems genuinely surprised by the accolades. \u201cIn flats and sweats!\u201d she says, stretching out a leg. \u201cIf only I knew they were coming, I would\u2019ve at least put on a cute little thing.\u201d\\n\\nWith the sudden release of \u201cFormation\u201d during _Anti_\u2019s week of ascendance up the charts, it\u2019s no wonder the Internet is pitting Beyonc\xe9 and Rihanna against each other. But that\u2019s not how Rihanna thinks. \u201cHere\u2019s the deal,\u201d she says. \u201cThey just get so excited to feast on something that\u2019s negative. Something that\u2019s competitive. Something that\u2019s, you know, a rivalry. And that\u2019s just not what I wake up to. Because I can only do me. And nobody else is going to be able to do that.\u201d\\n\\n[#image: /photos/589175fee8e3104f57c73804]||||||\\n\\n\\nON AN ICY FEBRUARY NIGHT in New York, a line gathers outside 23 Wall Street, once the headquarters of J.P. Morgan\u2019s banking empire and tonight the venue for the Fashion Week debut of Fenty, the new Puma collection by Rihanna, who was named women\u2019s creative director of the sportswear company in late 2014. Inside, [Naomi Campbell](http://www.vogue.com/tag/model/naomi-campbell), Chris Rock, and the rapper Wale are finding their seats.\\n\\nRihanna isn\u2019t the first music celebrity to try her hand at fashion design. But how involved was she in the process? \u201cVery dedicated,\u201d the CEO of Puma, Bj\xf6rn Gulden, says backstage. \u201cShe picked every single fabric,\u201d says Melissa Battifarano, the design director behind the collection, motioning to a table of high-end do-rags, nineties chokers (a signature Rihanna accessory), and faux-fur fanny packs. (This echoes what many on Rihanna\u2019s team have said. \u201cThere isn\u2019t an image, a font, a piece of clothing that she does not approve,\u201d her longtime manager, Jay Brown, says.)\\n\\nIt\u2019s a natural move: Rihanna loves fashion, and fashion designers love her. [Tom Ford](http://www.vogue.com/tag/designer/tom-ford) describes her style as \u201cdaring, fearless, and constantly evolving.\u201d (Rihanna, in turn, says of Ford admiringly that he \u201cknows how to make a woman a bad bitch.\u201d) [Olivier Rousteing](http://www.vogue.com/tag/designer/olivier-rousteing) of [Balmain](http://www.vogue.com/tag/designer/balmain) likens her to Michael Jackson, [David Bowie](http://www.vogue.com/tag/celebrity/david-bowie), and Prince: \u201cWhether masculine or feminine, she makes it sexy. She has this strength and modernity.\u201d\\n\\nShe seems very comfortable in the role. Just consider the dress she wore to accept the Fashion Icon Award from the Council of Fashion Designers of America in 2014, a sheer, Swarovski-encrusted [fishnet number by Adam Selman](http://www.vogue.com/866128/best-fashion-trends-cfda-awards-red-carpet/) that left little to the imagination. \u201cI just liked it better without the lines underneath. Could you imagine the CFDA dress with a bra? I would slice my throat. I already wanted to, for wearing a thong that wasn\u2019t bedazzled. That\u2019s the only regret I have in my life.\u201d Wearing a thong that wasn\u2019t bedazzled is your greatest regret in life? \u201cTo the CFDA Awards. Yes.\u201d\\n\\nNearly a year later, on the [Met Gala\u2019s 2015 red carpet](http://www.vogue.com/slideshow/13258404/2015-met-gala-red-carpet/#1), [so-called naked dresses](http://www.vogue.com/13258870/met-gala-fashion-trend-sheer-dresses-kim-kardashian-beyonce/) were rocked by [Jennifer Lopez](http://www.vogue.com/tag/celebrity/jennifer-lopez) (Atelier Versace), [Kim Kardashian West](http://www.vogue.com/tag/celebrity/kim-kardashian-west) (Roberto Cavalli), and Beyonc\xe9 (Givenchy Haute Couture by Riccardo Tisci). And what was Rihanna in? A magnificently regal, nearly ten-foot, 55-pound [canary-yellow cape](http://www.vogue.com/13259280/rihanna-met-gala-2015-dress-fashion-transformations/) that took the Chinese couturier Guo Pei two years to make, and which Rihanna sourced herself, on the Internet. \u201cShe really loves to experiment with silhouettes and texture and styles, but when something works, she is ready to run in the other direction,\u201d says her head stylist, [Mel Ottenberg](http://www.vogue.com/866144/rihanna-best-looks-of-all-time-mel-ottenberg/), who appears in many of the photographs of Rihanna that night, carrying the cape\u2019s massive embroidered train. \u201cMy tux was covered in yellow feathers,\u201d he says.\\n\\n+++inset-left\\n[#image: /photos/5891760097a3db337a24a81e]||||||\\n+++\\nBack on Wall Street, Rihanna\u2019s mom, Monica, told a reporter that her daughter has long been a chameleon. \u201cYou never knew what she would want,\u201d said Braithwaite, herself sporting a short platinum chop. \u201cOne time she wanted to have pants, another time she wanted to have a lot of frills. Always changing. Always switching it up. She\u2019s always been like that.\u201d Braithwaite is sitting with Rihanna\u2019s younger brothers, Rajad and Rorrey, and her grandfather, who is wearing a Roc Nation hoodie and hat.\\n\\nThe room darkens. Models appear through a haze of smoke and bound down the runway, through an \u201carctic urban forest,\u201d as hairstylist Yusef Williams describes it, in gothic streetwear with samurai flourishes. Luxe and futuristic, the collection references Hood by Air as well as Rihanna\u2019s own nonchalantly glamorous, globe-trotting lifestyle. \u201cLike if the Addams Family was wearing gymwear,\u201d she\u2019ll tell me later. The final piece, a black oversize faux-fur hoodie, is worn by Gigi Hadid, who closes the show as a gorgeous frostbitten witch, with matte black lips and streaks of white paint in her hair. Not one for understatement, Kanye, whose own new album and fashion show were presented the day before at Madison Square Garden, will review the show on Twitter: \u201cWow the paradigm has shifted. . . . Lil Sis kiiiiiiiilled this shit!!!!!!!\u201d\\n\\nBackstage, Rihanna and her team\u2014a tight-knit group with whom she travels everywhere, including Forde, Rosales, and Ciarra Pardo, her creative director of ten years and the head of her production company, also called Fenty\u2014are celebrating. Rihanna leaps from a couch and envelops me in a warm hug. Champagne is flowing. Pardo crosses the room to embrace Rihanna. \u201cYou killed it!\u201d she says. \u201cDidn\u2019t _they_ kill it?\u201d Rihanna says, deflecting credit to the models. \u201cHow do you feel?\u201d I ask. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m floating right now,\u201d she says. \u201cI feel elated.\u201d\\n\\n[#image: /photos/5891760223f9887c0e0e12e2]||||||\\n\\n\\nI ask her about her inspirations for the show, which include Japanese street culture (\u201cEvery time I go to Japan, it\u2019s like, \u2018Wow\u2019 \u201d) and nineties music and fashion. \u201cAll my favorite artists and fashion icons and models are from the nineties,\u201d she says, citing fellow glamazons Naomi Campbell and [Cindy Crawford](http://www.vogue.com/tag/model/cindy-crawford), as well as Mary J. Blige, Lil\u2019 Kim, [Gwen Stefani](http://www.vogue.com/tag/celebrity/gwen-stefani), [Jean Paul Gaultier](http://www.vogue.com/tag/designer/jean-paul-gaultier), and [John Galliano](http://www.vogue.com/tag/designer/john-galliano). \u201cEverybody was just so fearless.\u201d The room grows loud, and Rihanna shushes a group that happens to include Campbell. (Who else can shush Naomi Campbell?)\\n\\nPuma has already seen its fourth-quarter sales rise from Rihanna\u2019s involvement with the brand, which bodes well for her other collaborations this spring\u2014[with Manolo Blahnik on a shoe collection](http://www.vogue.com/13410559/rihanna-manolo-blahnik-spring-summer-2016-collaboration) and with Christian Dior on a line of sunglasses. Last year, Rihanna also became the first black face of Dior, a distinction that was initially lost on her, so caught up was she with \u201cthe Dior aspect.\u201d \u201cI was already proud to be a Dior woman, but to be a black Dior woman and the first: It did something else for me.\u201d\\n\\nIn her quest for world domination, Rihanna will no doubt keep upending outdated norms. It\u2019s not a coincidence that so many of her Puma designs are unisex. \u201cI always wanted to do what my brothers were doing,\u201d she says. \u201cI always wanted to play the games they played and play rough and wear pants and go outside.\u201d She still wants to. \u201cWomen feel empowered when they can do the things that are supposed to be only for men, you know?\u201d she says. \u201cIt breaks boundaries, it\u2019s liberating, and it\u2019s empowering when you feel like, Well, I can do that, too.\u201d\\n\\n_Watch the Fenty x Puma by Rihanna Fall 2016 Ready-to-Wear
