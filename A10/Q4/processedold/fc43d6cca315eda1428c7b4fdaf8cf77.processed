(Reuters/Gene Blevins)', u'Many scientists have predicted that climate change could cause wildfires to increase in the future. And\xa0a new study, just out on Monday, demonstrates', u'\xa0', u'just how much it\u2019s already been making them worse.', u'The paper, published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, suggests the effects of climate change have been helping make forests in the western United States\u2013 in states including New Mexico, Colorado, Wyoming, Montana and everything else to the west \u2014 drier and easier to burn since the 1970s. And in the last three decades, the study finds climate change played a role in nearly doubling the area hit by forest fires since 1984.', u'A primary way climate influences fire seasons is by causing the local vegetation to dry out, through changes in temperature, precipitation or other factors. Previous studies have suggested there\u2019s an \u201cincredibly strong and reliable\u201d relationship between the dryness of the climate and the area hit by forest fires, said ', u'Park Williams', u', one of the study\u2019s authors and a climate expert at Columbia University. ', u'So he and lead study author ', u'John Abatzoglou', u'The researchers examined eight different systems of measurement scientists commonly use to calculate the dryness of fuel in fire areas. Each one suggested that there have been significant increases in dryness between 1979 and 2015. The researchers also found there was a strong relationship between the increasing dryness and the area of land affected by forest fires. Overall, dryness accounted for more than three-quarters of the changes in burned area over the last three decades.', u'\u201cThat allows us to basically say that climate has been the predominant driver of area burned in these western forests,\u201d Abatzoglou said.', u'The researchers then applied a climate model to investigate how big a hand human-caused\xa0climate change has had in these changes, comparing what the fires look like when climate change is factored in versus what they look like when the effects of such\xa0climate changes are excluded.', u'Overall, the researchers found that anthropogenic climate change was responsible for just over half of the total observed increase in fuel dryness since 1979. In turn, this influence has added more than 16,000 square miles of forest fire area to the western United States since 1984 \u2014 an area ', u'larger than the state of Maryland', u'The other half of these observed changes can be attributed to natural climate variations, the researchers say. For example, the past few decades have seen significant declines in spring precipitation out west \u2014 a change that scientists have partly attributed to a shift in a natural, large-scale ocean-atmosphere pattern known as the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation, which can cause long-term changes in ocean temperatures and global weather patterns. \xa0', u'\u201cIt\u2019s this sort of compounding effect of natural climate variability aligning with climate change that has likely brought about this pretty significant increase we\u2019ve seen in forest fire activity,\u201d Abatzoglou said. ', u'That said, there are plenty of other factors that can affect the severity of fires besides just climate and dryness, even if these are likely the most dominant drivers. The abundance of vegetation in an area makes an obvious difference, Williams noted, as do events like lightning strikes and even some human fire management practices. Fire suppression tactics, for instance \u2014 preventing or snuffing out fires as much as possible \u2014 can lead to an overabundance of dry vegetation in some areas, increasing the likelihood of larger, more severe fires in the future. \xa0', u'But the big message is that climate is one of the biggest drivers of the recent increases in forest fires. And the effects are growing bigger and bigger over time, Williams noted. \xa0', u'\u201cThe fact is that this relationship between fuel aridity and forest fire area is exponential,\u201d he said.\xa0', u'\u201cThat means that every degree of warming has a bigger impact on forest fire area than the previous degree of warming. \u2026That explains to me why every year we hear career-long firefighters saying they\u2019ve never seen fires burning the way that they\u2019re burning.\u201d \xa0', u'And in the next few decades, the researchers believe we may see even bigger and more severe fires as the effects of climate change continue to grow. \xa0', u'\u201cGoing forward in the next three to four decades\u2026I expect fires to continue to become unrecognizable to previous generations,\u201d Williams said. \u201cIn the 2030s, it is a very high likelihood that fires [will be] dwarfing the fires that we see today.\u201d \xa0', u'Past a certain point, it\u2019s possible that so much burning will have taken place that there won\u2019t be enough fuel to continue feeding the flames, and so the fires will naturally begin to shrink down again, he added. But for decades at least, it\u2019s likely that forest fires will continue to grow. \xa0', u'And that\u2019s a reality that communities in the western U.S. should start to prepare for, the researchers note. This includes setting up fire breaks around town, planning escape routes and investing in public education about healthy fire management techniques, like controlled burning.', u'\u201cOne thing we all need to do is just get used to the idea that there are going to be continued increases in forest fire area,\u201d Williams said. \u201cAnd that means that towns that are situated in locations surrounded by forest need to make sure they are expecting a big fire to come through.
