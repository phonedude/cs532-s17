I think it\u2019s dangerous. Very dangerous.\u201d', u'\u201cIt\u2019s certainly extremely hazardous to have an ignorant,\nthin-skinned megalomaniac who sends off, you know, [tweets] at 3am if somebody\nangered him,\u201d he added.', u'Asked about an interview in 2010 where he had warned that \u201cfrustration\nand justified anger\u201d in the US could lead the country down a road similar to\npre-war Germany, Chomsky said: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t compare it with Germany,\u201d adding \u201cHitler\nwas a sincere, dedicated ideologue.
