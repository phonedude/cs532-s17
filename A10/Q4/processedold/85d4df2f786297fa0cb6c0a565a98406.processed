Avelar says that \u201cpeople know what\u2019s going on\nbut they\u2019re afraid to talk, and even worse, they don\u2019t want to talk to the\npolice.\u201d', u'One group, Los\nExterminos or The Exterminators first came to prominence last year when seven\nbodies were found \u2013 each with bullet holes in their heads. And in this cycle of\nviolence, it appears that these hit squads have the public\u2019s support because in\nthe absence of any effective state deterrent, these hitmen are fighting back\nagainst the MS13 stronghold.', u'A leaked classified\ndocument seen by Avelar, gives an account of the formal investigation into the\ngroup\u2019s activities. It describes a group of heavily armed men operating from\nseveral 4x4 vehicles, hunting down suspected gang members, allegedly being done\nwith the full knowledge of the overstretched Salvadorian police force. \xa0It also says a number of local business men\nare also under investigation for supplying weapons and vehicles. \xa0According to Avelar there\u2019s also evidence\nthat The Exterminators have a book or list, \u2018All my sources confirm that the\ninformation in the book comes from the police. \nOnly the police have the names, photographs and details of the alleged\ncriminals.\u201d', u'Gang crime that\nis difficult to control is extortion, and many small business owners are\nthreatened if they don\u2019t pay the \u2018rent\u2019 demanded. \xa0Will Sagado, former Mayor of San Miguel spent\ntwo years in prison convicted of being a founder member of a death squad, Black\nShadow that operated in the 90s. \xa0He\nstill denies this but explains, \u201cWe have to take the law into our own\nhands. We\u2019ve lost faith in the\nauthorities\u201d.', u'After much\nnegotiation, Avelar gets to meet with a heavily disguised member of MS-13 who\ndenies the gang extorts and claims they help people, \u201cWe don\u2019t mess with\nanybody. We lead our own lives. \xa0Looking\nafter our territory, our families and the people living here. \xa0The police and The Exterminators are carrying\nout the killings.\u201d \xa0', u'The\nExterminators also agreed for a spokesperson to be filmed, on the understanding\nof strict anonymity. \xa0He says of police\nand army \u201cthey will never be able to truly protect our communities. \xa0We have to defend ourselves. \xa0They were taking everything from us\u2026. \xa0We are few but we are winning the\nbattle. We will let the gang know that\npoor people are not scared anymore.\u201d \xa0', u'Finally, Avelar\nalso meets the highest ranking policeman, Inspector Malariaga, who is one of 20\npolicemen under investigation. \xa0He shows\nimages of the gang\u2019s violence on his cell phone to Avelar, which is too\nshocking to be included in the film. \u201cThey cut people into little piece without\nmercy\u2026 it doesn\u2019t remotely touch their soul to take someone\u2019s life away.\u201d He\nsays he understands there are \u201chonourable people who help protect, for example,\npeople from the countryside who are defenceless\u201d, and that \u201cPolice might go\nonce or twice a month but these criminals live there. So that\u2019s why these\npeople decide to take matters into their own hands.\u201d \xa0Yet he denies involvement with the hit squads\nsaying \u201cI was unaware as to what they were doing\u201d. \xa0', u'Of the 20 policemen\nplaced under investigation, fifteen of those are from the anti-extortion\ndepartment. \xa0The Attorney General\u2019s\noffice in San Salvador says it is investigating these claims but in the\nmeantime the murders go on - feeding the cycle of violence in which the lines\nbetween criminality and the law are blurred out of all recognition.', u'-\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\nEnds -', u'You can watch the full episode:', u'LATIN AMERICA INVESTIGATES', u': ', u'http://aje.io/xg2c', u'Note to Editors', u'If using quotes or the\nabove link please credit Al Jazeera English and Latin America\nInvestigates', u'For more information\nor images please contact:', u'Read more', u'Facebook', u'Twitter', u'About', u"The Public Relations team at Al Jazeera sharing what's new and exclusive.", u'People I follow', u'Al Jazeera PR', u'Home', u'About', u'Awards', u'Contact Us', u'Archive', u'\xa9 Copyright Al Jazeera 2012\u20132017']
