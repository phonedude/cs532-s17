Taylor is the only artist in history to have three albums selling over one million copies in their first week of release (2010's\xa0", u'Speak Now', u',\xa0', u"2012's\xa0", u'RED', u'\xa0', u"and 2014's\xa0", u'1989', u'). Taylor, a ten-time GRAMMY winner, is a singer, musician and songwriter, and not only the youngest winner in history, but the ', u'only', u'Album of the Year\xa0', u"twice. Taylor has an album on Rolling Stone's prestigious\xa0", u'The 50 Greatest Albums of All Time', u"\xa0(by women) list, she is Billboard's youngest-ever\xa0", u'Woman of the Year', u'\xa0and the only artist to have been awarded this honor twice, Time magazine has named her one the of the\xa0', u'100 Most Influential People', u'\xa0in the world and one of only eight candidates for their most prestigious honor, ', u'2014 Person of the Year ', u"and is the\xa0inaugural\xa0recipient\xa0of AMA's\xa0", u'Dick Clark Award for Excellence', u".\xa0The number of awards she has won and the sales figures only tell part of Taylor's story. It\u2019s the intangibles that elevate Taylor into the stratosphere of our pop culture planet, allowing the 26-year old singer-songwriter to orbit in a more rarified air. Her large-scale charitable contributions are one thing, but it\u2019s in the small gestures \u2013 the notes of compassion she posts on the Instagram photos of lovelorn fans, the genuine hugs she distributes without discretion \u2013 where Swift proves time and time again that platinum-selling, record-setting success has not changed her inherent nature. She is awkwardly honest and powerfully empathetic; a brazen superfan, loyal friend, fierce protector of hearts; and one of the world\u2019s greatest ambassadors for the power of just being yourself.", u'\xa9 2016 AT&T Intellectual Property.
