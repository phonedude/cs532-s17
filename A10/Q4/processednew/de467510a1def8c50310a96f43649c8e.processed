McCaskill', u'09/08/16 02:30 PM EDT', u'Vice President Joe Biden on Thursday urged Senate Republicans to hold a confirmation vote on Merrick Garland, warning of \u201cthe incredibly dangerous precedent\u201d the upper chamber would set if it continues to block the Supreme Court nominee\u2019s confirmation through the remainder of Barack Obama\u2019s presidency.', u'\u201cGive Merrick Garland a vote. Look, folks, you don\u2019t have to \u2014 my friends in the Senate, they don\u2019t have to support Merrick Garland,\u201d Biden said, speaking to reporters on the steps of the House with a contingent of House and Senate Democrats behind him. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to support the chief judge of the [D.C.] Circuit. Vote no, but give him a vote.\u201d', u'Story Continued Below', u'Obama nominated Garland, the centrist chief judge of the D.C. Circuit of Appeals, in March following the death in February of Justice Antonin Scalia. Senate Republicans, however, have refused to hold hearings or a vote on Garland\u2019s confirmation, saying that the vacancy should not be addressed until 2017, when a new president takes office.', u'\u201cWe\u2019re setting an incredibly dangerous precedent in the institution that I love, that I served in 36 years,\u201d Biden warned. \u201cI\u2019m prouder of being in the Senate over that time than anything I\u2019ve done in my whole life, but don\u2019t \u2014 don\u2019t set this dangerous precedent.\u201d', u'Since Obama nominated Garland to replace Scalia, 176 days have elapsed. Garland on Thursday met privately with Vermont Sen. Patrick Leahy, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, who \u2014 according to a spokeswoman \u2014 wanted to assure him that Democrats are still pushing for his confirmation this year.', u'Merrick Garland to visit Senate again', u'Seung Min Kim', u'Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) signaled late last month during Congress\u2019 summer recess that Senate Republicans might relent if enough senators push for a hearing after the November election. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s office, however, threw cold water on any idea that Garland will have a hearing in 2016, noting that the Kentucky Republican has been clear \u2014 \u201cthe next president will make this nomination.\u201d', u'Every Supreme Court nominee was greeted by the Judiciary Committee and received a hearing when Biden chaired the Senate panel, Biden said.', u'\u201cIt is the Senate\u2019s responsibility to act up or down. And the fact of the matter is, every nominee, including Anthony Kennedy in an election year, got an up-or-down vote,\u201d Biden continued. \u201cNot much of the time, not most of the time. All the time. Every single solitary time, and there\u2019s real consequences for continuing to leave this post vacant.\u201d', u"Biden also pushed Republicans to act on additional priorities, including Zika funding and gun-restriction legislation, and suggested that the dysfunction in Congress diminishes the nation's international clout.", u'World leaders \u201cunderstand that the presidency is powerful, but the Congress is equally as powerful,\u201d Biden said. \u201cThey understand our system, and they understand without the ability of this Congress to function, it impacts on our ability to conduct foreign policy. So it\u2019s not just the dysfunction that occurs here at home. It\u2019s internationally, and it\u2019s real. I\u2019m not exaggerating.\u201d', u'Biden closed his relatively brief remarks \u2014 he prefaced his comments by promising to speak quickly \u201cbecause we\u2019re all feeling the heat, but so are the American people,\u201d as he spoke in 90-plus degree heat in Washington \u2014 by insisting that his Democratic and Republican friends in Congress \u201cknow we\u2019ve got to end the dysfunction.\u201d', u'\u201cThe single most significant thing we can do now is act on all of those things that are absolute consensus and fulfill your constitutional responsibility,\u201d he said. \u201cSo act on the national health emergency. Now \u2014 no riders. Act on no-fly, no-buy,\u201d he said, referring to a measure to limit terrorism suspects\' ability to purchase firearms. "There\u2019s a lot more I want to do with concern to background checks, but act now. And do your job in terms of not spreading the dysfunction of the Congress to the Supreme Court of the United States.\u201d', u'Authors:', u'Nolan D.
