The WTTC, located in the Charlestown neighborhood of Boston, is specifically designed to help the wind industry test the next generation of land-based and offshore wind turbine blades. The WTTC opened in 2011 and was funded by the Department of Energy (DOE) under the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act, and is an example of a crucial investment made during the Obama Administration to help the United States maintain its position as a leader in wind electricity generation. This new wind energy strategy is a part of President Obama\u2019s Climate Action Plan that will create American jobs and cut carbon pollution by developing America's clean energy resources.", u'The strategy was published just weeks after construction was completed on America\u2019s first offshore commercial wind farm off of Block Island, RI. The new 30 MW wind farm was BOEM\u2019s first right-of-way grant and is expected to start operating by the end of 2016. It will generate enough electricity to power 17,000 homes in New England. Across the country, states like Massachusetts, which just passed an energy bill that requires utilities to get 1600 MW of their power from offshore wind by the summer of 2027, are accelerating the development of offshore wind across our nation\u2019s coastal states.\xa0', u"\u201cThis Administration has made significant investments in clean energy technologies, supporting a diversified energy portfolio to help meet our Climate Action Plan goal of permitting 20,000 MW of renewable electricity generation on public lands and waters by 2020,\u201d said Secretary Jewell. \u201cThanks to involvement by partners at all levels of government, community stakeholders, tribes and the public, we've been able to stand up the first federal offshore wind energy program in the history of the U.S. and we are confident the strategy we're outlining today will chart a course for additional investment in clean energy technologies that can help power America's future.\u201d", u'\u201cOffshore wind has experienced enormous progress during the Obama administration. The first offshore wind farm has now finished construction, and we have gone from zero offshore wind areas leased before this administration to eleven areas that total the size of Rhode Island,\u201d said Energy Secretary Moniz. \u201cToday\u2019s collaborative strategic plan is part of a long-term commitment to support innovation that enables widespread offshore wind deployment and shows how offshore wind will benefit our country with new jobs, less pollution, and a more diversified electricity mix.\u201d', u'The National Offshore Wind Strategy identifies key challenges facing the industry and more than 30 specific actions that DOE and DOI can take over the next five years to address those challenges. These actions fall into three strategic areas:', u'1.\xa0\xa0 \xa0Reducing technical costs and risks. DOI proposes the joint development of standard data collection guidelines to foster predictability and inform safe project development \xa0and DOE will work to increase annual energy production and reliability of offshore wind plants.', u'2.\xa0\xa0 \xa0Supporting effective stewardship. DOI commits to numerous actions to ensure that the regulatory process is predictable, transparent, efficient and informed by lessons learned from regulators in other countries. Additionally, as the first generation of installed projects come online, DOI and DOE will collect field data on parts of offshore development including impacts on marine life and turbine radar interference in order to support future offshore wind siting and plan reviews.\xa0', u'3.\xa0\xa0 \xa0Improving the market conditions for investment in offshore wind energy. Studies are needed help quantify the broad grid integration impacts of adding significant amounts of offshore wind energy to the power system. Such information could significantly benefit the offshore wind community by informing state policies critical to supporting development.', u"Today\u2019s strategy builds on DOE and DOI's first joint offshore wind strategy, published in 2011. Since then, the Energy Department has allocated nearly $200 million to support three cutting-edge offshore wind demonstration projects led by the University of Maine, New Jersey\u2019s Fishermen\u2019s Energy, and Ohio\u2019s Lake Erie Energy Development Corporation, and research and development investments in technologies that specifically address the opportunities and challenges across U.S. waters. Additionally, since 2010, the Department of the Interior has issued 11 commercial leases for offshore wind development, nine of which generated approximately $16 million through competitive lease sales and covered more than one million acres of federal waters.", u'DOE has found that developing 86,000 MW of these offshore wind energy resources by 2050 would support 160,000 jobs, reduce power sector water consumption by 5 percent, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 1.8 percent.', u'The full report, National Offshore Wind Strategy: Facilitating the Development of the Offshore Wind Industry in the United States, is online at ', u'wind.energy.gov', u'.', u'Press Release', u'Share', u'Facebook', u'Twitter', u'Google+', u'LinkedIn', u'Delicious', u'Digg', u'Reddit', u'StumbleUpon', u'Pinterest', u'Interior to Hold Public Listening Sessions on Future of Navajo Generating Station', u'Read more', u'Press Release', u'Share', u'Facebook', u'Twitter', u'Google+', u'LinkedIn', u'Delicious', u'Digg', u'Reddit', u'StumbleUpon', u'Pinterest', u'Interior Department Releases List of Monuments Under Review, Announces First-Ever Formal Public Comment Period for Antiquities Act Monuments', u'Read more', u'Press Release', u'Share', u'Facebook', u'Twitter', u'Google+', u'LinkedIn', u'Delicious', u'Digg', u'Reddit', u'StumbleUpon', u'Pinterest', u'Interior Announces Share the Experience 2016 Photo Contest Winners', u'Read more', u'Instagram', u'Facebook', u'Twitter', u'Tumblr', u'Flickr', u'About', u'Meet the Secretary', u'Bureaus', u'For Employees', u'Our Priorities', u'American Energy', u'Climate Change', u'Jobs', u'Regulatory Reform', u'Stewardship', u'Tribal Nations', u'Resources', u'Cobell / Land Buy-back', u'Deepwater Horizon', u'Hurricane Sandy', u'Open Government Initiative', u'Strategic Plan', u'Contact Us', u'FOIA', u'Open Government', u'Integrity of Scientific & Scholarly Activities', u'USA.gov', u'BusinessUSA', u'White House', u'No FEAR Act', u'Inspector General', u'Agency Financial Report', u'Budget & Performance', u'Tribal Leaders Directory', u'DOI Home', u'Contact Us', u'Privacy Policy', u'Disclaimer', u'Notices', u'Accessibility', u'Copyright', u'Digital Media Guide', u'Site Map', u'U.S. Department of the Interior, 1849 C Street NW, Washington, DC 20240.
