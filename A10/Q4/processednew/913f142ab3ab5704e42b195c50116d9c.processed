But when it's out of control\x97as in rheumatoid arthritis\x97it can damage the body. Plus, it's thought to play a role in obesity, heart disease, and cancer. ", u'Foods high in sugar and saturated fat can spur inflammation. \u201cThey cause overactivity in the immune system, which can lead to joint pain, fatigue, and damage to the blood vessels,\u201d says Scott Zashin, MD, clinical professor at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas.', u'Other foods may curb inflammation. Add these items to your plate today.', u'View all ', u'Photo: Getty Images\n', u'Fatty fish', u'Oily fish, like salmon, mackerel, tuna and sardines, are high in omega-3 fatty acids, which can help reduce inflammation. Aim to eat fish several times a week, cooked in healthy ways: In a 2009 study, men who consumed the most omega-3s each day from baked or boiled fish (as opposed to fried, dried or salted) cut their risk of death from heart disease by 23 percent, compared with those who ate the least. Women had a less dramatic drop but were also protected.', u'Not a fan of seafood? Fish oil supplements may help lower inflammation. Also, reduce your intake of omega-6 fatty acids (found in processed foods and some vegetable oils); a healthy balance between omega-3s and omega-6s is essential.', u'View all ', u'Photo: Getty Images\n', u'Whole grains', u'Consuming most of your grains as whole grains, as opposed to refined, white bread, cereal, rice, and pasta can help keep harmful inflammation at bay. That\u2019s because whole grains have more fiber, which has been shown to ', u'reduce levels of C-reactive protein', u', a marker of inflammation in the blood.', u'One caveat: Not all products labeled \u201cwhole grain\u201d are necessarily healthier than their refined counterparts. To be sure you\u2019re getting the good stuff, look for foods in which the total number of carbohydrate grams per serving is fewer than 10 times the number of fiber grams.', u'View all ', u'Photo: Getty Images\n', u'Dark leafy greens', u'Vitamin E may be key in protecting the body against pro-inflammatory molecules called cytokines. One of the best sources of this vitamin is dark green veggies, such as spinach, Swiss chard, kale and broccoli. Dark greens and cruciferous vegetables also have higher concentrations of certain nutrients\u2014like calcium, iron and disease-fighting flavonoids\u2014than veggies with lighter-colored leaves.', u'View all ', u'Photo: Getty Images\n', u'Nuts', u'Another source of inflammation-fighting healthy fats is nuts. Almonds are particularly rich in fiber, calcium and vitamin E, and walnuts have high amounts of alpha-linolenic acid, a type of omega-3 fat. All nuts are packed with antioxidants that can help your body fight off and repair the damage caused by inflammation. Nuts (along with fish, leafy greens and whole grains) are also a big part of the Mediterranean diet, shown in one study to reduce markers of inflammation in as little as six weeks.', u'View all ', u'Photo: Getty Images\n', u'Soy\n', u'Studies have suggested that isoflavones\u2014compounds in soy that the body converts into estrogenlike chemicals\u2014may help lower CRP and inflammation levels in women. A 2007 study published in the ', u'Journal of Inflammation', u'Avoid heavily-processed soy whenever possible, which may not include the same benefits and is usually paired with additives and preservatives. Instead, aim to get more soy milk, tofu, and edamame (boiled soybeans) into your regular diet.', u'View all ', u'Photo: Getty Images\n', u'Low-fat dairy', u'Milk products are sometimes considered a trigger food for inflammatory diseases like rheumatoid arthritis, because some people have allergies or intolerances to casein, the protein found in dairy. But for people who can tolerate it, low-fat and nonfat milk are an important source of nutrients. Yogurt can also contain probiotics, which can reduce gut inflammation.', u'\u201cFoods with calcium and vitamin D, such as yogurt and skim milk, are good for everyone,\u201d says Karen H. Costenbader, MD, associate professor of medicine and rheumatoid arthritis doctor at Harvard Medical School. In addition to their anti-inflammatory properties, she says, \u201cit is important to get enough calcium and vitamin D for bone strength, and possibly reduction of cancer and other health risks.\u201d', u'View all ', u'Photo: Getty Images\n', u'Peppers\n', u'\u201cColorful vegetables are part of a healthier diet in general,\u201d says Dr. Costenbader. \u201cAs opposed to white potatoes or corn, colorful  peppers, tomatoes, squash, and leafy vegetables have high quantities of antioxidant vitamins and lower levels of starch.\u201d Bell peppers are available in a variety of colors, while hot peppers (like chili and cayenne) are rich in capsaicin, a chemical that\u2019s used in topical creams that reduce pain and inflammation. ', u'Peppers, however, are nightshade vegetables\x97which some doctors and patients believe can exacerbate inflammation in people with rheumatoid arthritis. \u201cWhat helps one person may be harmful to another,\u201d says Dr. Zashin. \u201cYou just need to pay attention to your diet and your symptoms, and stick with what works for you.\u201d', u'View all ', u'Photo: Getty Images\n', u'Tomatoes', u'Tomatoes, another nightshade veggie, may also help reduce inflammation in some people. (Of course, Dr. Zashin\u2019s advice about what works for you, individually, applies here, as well.)', u'Tomatoes are rich in lycopene, which helps reduce inflammation in the lungs and throughout the rest of the body. Cooked tomatoes provide even more lycopene than raw ones, so tomato sauce works, too\u2014and a ', u'2013 Iranian study', u'View all ', u'Photo: Getty Images\n', u'Beets', u'This vegetable\u2019s brilliant red color is a tip-off to its equally brilliant antioxidant properties: Beets (and beetroot juice) can not only reduce inflammation but may also protect against cancer and heart disease, thanks to their generous helping of fiber, folate, and powerful plant pigments called betalains.', u'View all ', u'Photo: Getty Images\n', u'Ginger and turmeric', u'These spices, common in Asian and Indian cooking, have been shown in various studies to hold anti-inflammatory properties. \u201cWhile the evidence in terms of RA inflammation is not very strong, they are vegetables\u2014and part of a healthy, vegetable-rich diet,\u201d says Dr. Costenbader.', u"Turmeric, the pungent, golden spice used in curry, appears to work in the body by helping to turn off NF-kappa B, a compound that's integral to triggering the process of inflammation, research shows. Turmeric's cousin ginger, meanwhile, may cut inflammation in the gut when taken in supplement form.", u'View all ', u'Photo: Getty Images\n', u'Garlic and onions', u'There\u2019s good reason these pungent vegetables are considered anti-inflammatory superstars. Organosulfur compounds derived from garlic may lower the production of substances in the blood that boost inflammation. Quercetin, a flavonoid in onions, helps inhibit inflammation-causing agents at play in arthritis. For the greatest benefits, eat garlic raw, or let crushed or chopped cloves stand for 10 minutes before cooking. And opt for red or yellow onions or shallots instead of white or sweet varieties.', u'View all ', u'Photo: Getty Images\n', u'Olive oil\n', u'\u201cAnything that fits into a heart-healthy diet is probably also good for inflammation\x97and that includes healthy, plant-based fats like olive oil,\u201d says Dr. Zashin, author of ', u'Natural Arthritis Treatment', u'amazon.com', u"). In fact, a 2010 Spanish study reported that the Mediterranean diet's heart-health perks may be largely due to its use of olive oil. Oleocanthal, the source of olive oil's distinctive aftertaste, has been shown to have similar effects as ibuprofen. A 2014 study found that higher blood levels of alpha-tocopherol, a form of vitamin E in olive oil, were linked to better lung function; more gamma-tocopherol, a kind of vitamin E in corn and soybean oils, was associated with higher rates of asthma, possibly due to vitamin E's role in inflammation.", u'View all ', u'Photo: Getty Images\n', u'Berries', u'All fruits can help fight inflammation in the body, because they\u2019re high in fiber and antioxidants. But berries have especially strong anti-inflammatory benefits\u2014possibly owing to the powers of anthocyanins, the antioxidant flavonoids that give berries their rich color.', u'Studies have demonstrated, for example, that red raspberry extract helps prevent animals from developing arthritis; that blueberries can protect against inflammatory intestinal disorders like ', u'ulcerative colitis', u', as well as lower blood pressure and heart attack risk; and that women who eat more strawberries may have lower levels of CRP.', u'View all ', u'Photo: Getty Images\n', u'Tart cherries', u'Tart cherries contain the \u201chighest anti-inflammatory content of any food,\u201d according to a 2012 presentation by Oregon Health & Science University scientists. Research has found that tart cherry juice powder can reduce the inflammation in lab rats\u2019 blood vessels by up to 50%; in humans, it helps athletes recover faster from intense workouts and decreases post-exertion muscle pain.', u'Experts believe that eating 1.5 cups of tart cherries or drinking 1 to 1.5 cups of tart cherry juice a day may yield similar benefits. And, yep, the cherries have got to be tart\u2014sweet ones don\u2019t seem to have the same effects.', u'sponsored stories', u'more from health', u'Rheumatoid Arthritis', u'8 Signs and Symptoms of Rheumatoid Arthritis\n', u'Food', u'17 Superfoods That Fight Disease\n', u'Rheumatoid Arthritis', u'Best and Worst Jobs for People in Pain', u'Fitness\n', u'Why I Run\n', u'trending', u'How to Make 3-Ingredient Pancakes', u'7 Foods That Help You Sleep', u'11 Kombucha Facts You Should Know Before Giving It a Try\n', u'5 Foods to Eat for Vitamin D', u'How to Make Overnight Oats', u'12 Low-Calorie Foods That Speed Weight Loss', u'5 Foods With More Potassium Than a Banana', u'The Fastest Exercise to Lift Your Butt', u'GET Healthy Now', u'News, workouts, recipes, and more.', u'Sign up', u'No Thanks', u'Rheumatoid Arthritis', u'5 Things You Need to Know About Rheumatoid Arthritis', u'Rheumatoid Arthritis', u'FDA Approves Erelzi, a Biosimilar Version of Enbrel, for Rheumatoid Arthritis', u'Rheumatoid Arthritis', u'FDA Calls BS on Spa Industry\u2019s Cryotherapy Claims', u'Rheumatoid Arthritis', u'Rheumatoid Arthritis Diet Tips', u'Rheumatoid Arthritis', u'8 Signs and Symptoms of Rheumatoid Arthritis', u'Rheumatoid Arthritis', u'10 Ways Rheumatoid Arthritis Affects the Body', u'Rheumatoid Arthritis', u'10 Ways to Ease Rheumatoid Arthritis Pain', u'Rheumatoid Arthritis', u"Arthritis Pain?
