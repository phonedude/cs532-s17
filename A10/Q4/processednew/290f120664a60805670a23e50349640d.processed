While that represents a 16.6 million album drop, it\u2019s actually a significant improvement over the same stretch of 2014, which had a decline of 42 million units. Digital track sales lost nearly 100 million in sales, standing at 756.3 million from 848.5 million last year. Conversely, digital album sales are holding their own, down less than one-third of 1 percent.', u'Meanwhile, streaming numbers have nearly doubled during the past year. In the first nine months of 2015, streams totaled 232 billion versus 118.1 billion in the same period of 2014. SEA -- stream-equivalent albums, whereby 1,500 streams equal one album sale -- are up 96 percent to 154.6 million units, from 78.8 million in 2014.', u'Notably, the only genre -- from pop to rock to hip-hop -- that saw a ', u'lift', u'Taylor Swift\u2019s ', u'1989', u'Ed Sheeran', u'\u2019s ', u'x', u'Fifty Shades of Grey', u'Mark Ronson', u'\u2019s \u201cUptown Funk!\u201d (featuring ', u'Bruno Mars', u') with 5.3 million units, followed by Sheeran\u2019s \u201cThinking Out Loud\u201d (3.8 million). Individual track sales kept up their steep decline, dropping 10.9 percent to 756.3 million from 848.5 million in the first nine months of 2014. However, digital album sales dipped just 0.3 percent to 77.3 million units.', u'The three major labels maintained their market-share positions from Q3 2014 and weathered changes of less than one percentage point (Universal and Warner gained while Sony slipped).

The big losers are the mass merchants, which have seen sales fall 17.9 percent in the last year to 32.9 million units, from 40 million. Music executives believe this decline can be attributed to a decrease in stores' space allotment for CDs, as well as lost sales due to digital-only releases. Non-traditional record stores -- think Amazon -- continue to shine, actually growing 8.1 percent. Mom and pop record shops were down slightly, to 12.7 million from 13.1 million units.
