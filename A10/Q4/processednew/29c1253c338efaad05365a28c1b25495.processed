Thanks to the demands of the 24-hour news cycle, every Instagram post by a pop star has become a source of intrigue, every teased video clip fodder for frenzied speculation. On this particular afternoon, the RiRi chatter, robust on any day, is reaching peak hysteria.', u'Kendall Jenner, Cara Delevingne, and more of Rihanna\u2019s Navy pay tribute to \u201cWork\u201d:', u'Ten days earlier, ', u'Rihanna', u'Anti', u', her first album since 2012. For seven years, she had released a new pop confection every year, like clockwork. Then, suddenly, nothing. It wasn\u2019t just the timing.

She\u2019s listening to a remix of Sia\u2019s \u201cChandelier,\u201d occasionally belting out a lyric in that inimitable Bajan tone: \u201cI\u2019m gonna live like tomorrow doesn\u2019t exist!

Not afraid to show us her flaws, Rihanna inspires us to, as her friend ', u'Cara Delevingne', u'This take-it-or-leave-it realness is what draws young women into the ranks of Rihanna\u2019s fiercely loyal fan base, known as her Navy, after a lyric from her song \u201cG4L.\u201d And in 2016, the Navy is going to get a lot of Rihanna.', u'Over the next few weeks alone, her plan is to fly to New York to debut ', u'a collection', u'Grammys', u'; then head to London to perform at the Brit Awards (she will grind with Drake in white-hot fringed pants); and, two days after that, go back to California to begin a 63-city world tour. Her looks on tour are \u201cinspired by neutral earth tones,\u201d she says, \u201cand evolve from one extreme to the other as the show progresses.\u201d Joining her will be Big Sean and the Weeknd in Europe, as well as Travis Scott, whom she\u2019s been seen out with in the last few months. \u201cI like to bring people who can get the crowd excited,\u201d she says.', u'\u201cI probably am going to have like four days of tour rehearsal in total, which is Freaking. Me. Out,\u201d Rihanna says. It\u2019s after 9:00 p.m., the shoot is over, and we\u2019re sitting cross-legged in red leather recliners in the home theater of the Beverly Hills house, sipping Pinot Grigio from Dixie cups. \u201cMy schedule is so crazy right now.\u201d It\u2019s why, she says, she\u2019s single: \u201cIt\u2019s definitely going to be a challenge when I do decide to pursue a relationship . . . but I have hope!\u201d Exercise is also hard to find time for. \u201cI don\u2019t work out as much as I\u2019d like to,\u201d she says, \u201cbut my trainer Jamie is a beast and she makes me pay for it.\u201d', u'After her last tour, in 2013, for ', u'Unapologetic', u', Rihanna vowed to take a break from recording. \u201cI wanted to have a year to just do whatever I want artistically, creatively,\u201d she says. \u201cI lasted a week.\u201d The paparazzi got a picture of her going into the studio, \u201cand my fans were like, \u2018Oh, yes! We\u2019s droppin\u2019 a single.\u2019 \u201d From that moment, she says, the Navy was expecting an album. It would be another two years.', u'Turns out it takes a while to reinvent your sound. As Delevingne says, \u201c', u'Anti', u'\u2019s got its own genre, and that genre is ', u'her', u'.\u201d Had Rihanna gotten bored with the pop formula? \u201cVery much,\u201d the singer says. \u201cI just gravitated toward the songs that were honest to where I\u2019m at right now.\u201d From the first song, \u201cConsideration,\u201d a trip-hop collaboration with SZA, the message is clear. The chorus has Rihanna singing, \u201cI got to do things my own way, darling.\u201d It\u2019s \u201clike a PSA,\u201d she tells me. She recognizes the risks: \u201cIt might not be some automatic record that will be Top 40. But I felt like I earned the right to do that now.\u201d', u'\u201cI can only do me,\u201d the singer says.

I could make up with him.\u2019 Just, desperate.\u201d The candor is heightened by a husky, soul-inflected warmth. \u201cWe just said, \u2018You know what? Let\u2019s just drink some whiskey and record this song.\u2019 \u201d', u'Then there\u2019s \u201c', u'Work', u',\u201d on which she repeats the word ', u'work', u'Tommy Hilfiger dress', u'There have been a few singles dropped along the way, including \u201c', u'FourFiveSeconds', u',\u201d an acoustic collaboration with ', u'Kanye West', u'Bitch Better Have My Money', u',\u201d an over-the-top revenge fantasy whose video walked the line between empowerment and misogyny. \u201cIt\u2019s just a way to describe a situation,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a way to be in charge, to let people know that you\u2019re all about your business.\u201d', u'Over the past two years, Rihanna has definitely been all about her business. After fulfilling her contract with Def Jam, she created her own imprint, Westbury Road Entertainment, on Universal\u2019s Roc Nation label. In a bold move, she then acquired the masters of all her previous albums and made a reported $25 million promotional deal with Samsung. Robyn Rihanna Fenty, the island girl plucked from obscurity at sixteen by a posse of music moguls, is becoming one herself. It\u2019s because she\u2019s so attuned to the seismic changes in her industry that she also bought a share of Tidal. \u201cStreaming counts now,\u201d she says. Like any savvy businesswoman, Rihanna knows it\u2019s important to diversify. Last fall, she announced a new venture, Fr8me, an agency representing stylists and hair and makeup artists. She has a passionate interest in beauty and often scouts her own talent on Instagram.', u'In the midst of all this, she somehow found time to take a role in ', u'Val\xe9rian and the City of a Thousand Planets', u', a film based on a French comic series. Directed by Luc Besson, it costars Dane DeHaan and Delevingne and is due out in 2017. Speaking by phone, Besson is reluctant to give too much away about her character, except to say that her personality changes \u201cevery fifteen seconds.\u201d \u201cAs you can imagine, because she\u2019s number one in her business, she has a protection, like a crocodile,\u201d the director says of Rihanna. \u201cBut she really let herself go. I was so touched by her.\u201d', u'Earlier at the house, two men in suits arrived from the Recording Industry Association of America to present Rihanna with two plaques: one certifying ', u'Anti', u'\u2019s platinum status, the other commemorating a benchmark she reached last July, when she became the first artist in history to reach 100 million downloads online. (In another sign of the turbulent state of the music industry, reports will later cast doubt on ', u'Anti', u'\u2019s platinum status, pointing out that the RIAA took into account one million giveaways that were part of the Samsung deal.) Rihanna seems genuinely surprised by the accolades. \u201cIn flats and sweats!\u201d she says, stretching out a leg. \u201cIf only I knew they were coming, I would\u2019ve at least put on a cute little thing.\u201d', u'With the sudden release of \u201cFormation\u201d during ', u'Anti', u'\u2019s week of ascendance up the charts, it\u2019s no wonder the Internet is pitting Beyonc\xe9 and Rihanna against each other. But that\u2019s not how Rihanna thinks. \u201cHere\u2019s the deal,\u201d she says. \u201cThey just get so excited to feast on something that\u2019s negative. Something that\u2019s competitive. Something that\u2019s, you know, a rivalry. And that\u2019s just not what I wake up to. Because I can only do me. And nobody else is going to be able to do that.\u201d', u'\u201cAs you can imagine, because she\u2019s number one in her business, she has a protection, like a crocodile,\u201d says director Luc Besson.

Inside, ', u'Naomi Campbell', u', Chris Rock, and the rapper Wale are finding their seats.', u'Rihanna isn\u2019t the first music celebrity to try her hand at fashion design. But how involved was she in the process? \u201cVery dedicated,\u201d the CEO of Puma, Bj\xf6rn Gulden, says backstage. \u201cShe picked every single fabric,\u201d says Melissa Battifarano, the design director behind the collection, motioning to a table of high-end do-rags, nineties chokers (a signature Rihanna accessory), and faux-fur fanny packs. (This echoes what many on Rihanna\u2019s team have said. \u201cThere isn\u2019t an image, a font, a piece of clothing that she does not approve,\u201d her longtime manager, Jay Brown, says.)', u'It\u2019s a natural move: Rihanna loves fashion, and fashion designers love her.

She has this strength and modernity.\u201d', u'She seems very comfortable in the role.

Always changing. Always switching it up. She\u2019s always been like that.\u201d Braithwaite is sitting with Rihanna\u2019s younger brothers, Rajad and Rorrey, and her grandfather, who is wearing a Roc Nation hoodie and hat.', u'The room darkens. Models appear through a haze of smoke and bound down the runway, through an \u201carctic urban forest,\u201d as hairstylist Yusef Williams describes it, in gothic streetwear with samurai flourishes. Luxe and futuristic, the collection references Hood by Air as well as Rihanna\u2019s own nonchalantly glamorous, globe-trotting lifestyle. \u201cLike if the Addams Family was wearing gymwear,\u201d she\u2019ll tell me later. The final piece, a black oversize faux-fur hoodie, is worn by Gigi Hadid, who closes the show as a gorgeous frostbitten witch, with matte black lips and streaks of white paint in her hair. Not one for understatement, Kanye, whose own new album and fashion show were presented the day before at Madison Square Garden, will review the show on Twitter: \u201cWow the paradigm has shifted. . . . Lil Sis kiiiiiiiilled this shit!!!!!!!\u201d', u'Backstage, Rihanna and her team\u2014a tight-knit group with whom she travels everywhere, including Forde, Rosales, and Ciarra Pardo, her creative director of ten years and the head of her production company, also called Fenty\u2014are celebrating. Rihanna leaps from a couch and envelops me in a warm hug. Champagne is flowing.
