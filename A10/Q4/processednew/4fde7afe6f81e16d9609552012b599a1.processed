("Sorry" bowed at No. 2 on the Nov. 14, 2015, chart and has yet to leave the top tier.) Impressively, it\'s a mark Bieber already shared:', u"Most Weeks in Hot 100's Top 10 From Debut: 21 Each", u'"Sorry," Justin Bieber (2015-16)', u'"What Do You Mean?," Justin Bieber (2015-16)', u'"Sugar," Maroon 5 (2015)', u'"Starships," Nicki Minaj (2012)', u'Meanwhile, "Love Yourself" has spent its first 18 weeks in the top 10. The lofty chart lives of "Love," "Sorry" and "Mean," Bieber\'s first three Hot 100 No. 1s, further underscore the success of parent album ', u'Purpose', u', which itself has tallied its first 18 weeks on the Billboard 200 in the top five.

Her debut single, "The Way" (featuring Mac Miller), began at No. 10 on April 13, 2013, introducing her first LP (and first Billboard 200 No. 1) ', u'Yours Truly', u'. (The song would peak at No. 9.) On May 17, 2014, "Problem" (featuring Iggy Azalea) soared in at No. 3 (before peaking at a career-best No. 2), setting the stage for the No. 1 Billboard 200 entrance of ', u'My Everything', u'.', u'If this stat sounds familiar, we noted it in November when Grande\'s prior top 10, "Focus," debuted at No. 7 on the Hot 100 (its peak). At the time, "Focus" was believed to be the first single from the LP ', u'Moonlight', u". The set's title was subsequently changed to ", u'Dangerous Woman', u', however, and the title song became the new lead single, as "Focus" will not be on the new set, according to Republic Records.', u'So, to recap the quirky chronology: Grande was the first artist to debut in the Hot 100\'s top 10 with the first single from each of her first three albums \u2026 then wasn\'t when "Focus" was no longer the lead single from her third set \u2026 but now is again (!), since the new title single opens in the top 10.
