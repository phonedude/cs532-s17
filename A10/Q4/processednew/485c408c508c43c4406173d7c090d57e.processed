Drained. Pooped. No matter how you phrase it, you're beat and need to drum up some energy.", u'Generally reported by more women than men, sluggishness can be caused by many things. But experts say poor ', u'nutrition', u'nutrition', u"Here's what the experts have to say about making sure your body gets the right fuel when it needs it.", u'The Forgotten Meal', u"At the beginning of the day, most people dash off to work or school without a thought to their body's dietary needs. Who has time to eat in the morning anyway?", u'Mary Ellen Camire, PhD, professor of food science and human nutrition at the University of Maine says, "', u'Breakfast', u'breakfast', u'Research shows breakfast improves alertness and concentration, helps shed pounds by preventing overeating during the day, and prevents ', u'obesity', u', ', u'diabetes', u', and ', u'heart disease', u'.', u'To get these benefits and to prepare the body for the day, the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics recommends eating carbohydrates for energy and protein for endurance. Some quick options include:', u'Whole grain bagel with cheese', u'Cereal with fruit and yogurt', u'Whole grain toast with peanut butter and fruit', u'Hard-boiled egg sliced into a whole wheat pita', u'Scrambled eggs, toast, and fruit', u'Oatmeal with raisins', u'For the really busy bee, Camire says breakfast bars, frozen omelets, breakfast sandwiches, oatmeal packets, and whole grain cereals in prepackaged plastic bowls are good choices for eating on the go. Be mindful, though, of the sugar and fat content of your morning meal. A study in ', u'Pediatrics', u'Complex Carbohydrate Charge', u'Healthy eating', u'Continued', u"Although carbohydrates have gotten a bad reputation, the nutrient is still the body's preferred source of energy, says Dave Grotto, RD, director of nutrition at the Block Center for Integrative ", u'Cancer', u"The best way to maximize the body's potential for energy is to eat a combination of complex and simple carbohydrates. Complex carbohydrates, which are slow burning, should make up the bulk of the carbohydrates we eat, says Grotto. Whole grains and starchy vegetables such as potatoes, squash, pumpkin, and carrots fall into this category.", u'This does not mean ignoring simple carbohydrates with a faster burn, such as those found in fruits, vegetables, and honey. They can provide an immediate source of energy.', u'Simple sugars found in candy bars, soft drinks, and cookies can also provide a quick boost, but then a big letdown afterward.', u'"You are going to get a rise in energy from the original hit of the sugar," says John W. Finley, associate editor of the ', u'Journal of Agriculture and Food Chemistry,', u'Without complex carbohydrates to sustain ', u'blood', u'blood sugar', u'It is also important to make sure your complex carbohydrates have fiber, says Dee Sandquist, a spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. "Fiber helps the carbohydrates that we eat to be more slowly absorbed by the body," she says. "So, therefore, the body gets a more balanced release of energy, as opposed to the quick burst of energy."', u'Many processed carbohydrates, such as white rice, white bread, and pasta, contain little or no fiber, resulting in expending energy at a rapid rate. To ensure you have a food rich in fiber, check the label. A slice of bread should contain 2 to 3 grams of fiber.', u'Continued', u'Fat Force', u'Fat has gotten a bad rap, too, but it\'s one that\'s not entirely undeserved. "Bad" fats are associated with ', u'heart disease', u', some types of ', u'cancer', u', and some chronic illnesses. The right types of fat, however, are a concentrated source of energy. ', u'Saturated fat', u'trans fat', u'risk for heart disease', u'. Replacing saturated and trans fat in your diet with unsaturated fat (found in foods like olive oil, avocados, nuts, and canola oil) has been shown to decrease the risk of developing ', u'heart disease', u'.', u'In order to strike the right balance, choose polyunsaturated fats such as vegetable oils and seafood and monounsaturated fats such as olive oil, nuts, and seeds. The unsaturated variety can help lower "bad" ', u'LDL cholesterol', u'.', u'Protein Power', u'Fats and carbohydrates may supply the body with energy, but protein helps regulate the release of that power. Protein maintains cells, assists in growth, transports hormones and ', u'vitamins', u", and preserves lean muscle mass. Muscles and many hormones are, in fact, made up of protein. You need proteins for your immune system. So replenishing your body's source of the nutrient is very important.", u'Good sources of protein include meat, poultry, fish, eggs, beans, nuts, soy, and low-fat dairy products. When you eat these types of foods, your body breaks down the protein that they contain into amino acids (the building blocks of proteins). Some amino acids are essential, which means that you need to get them from your diet, and others are nonessential, which means that your body can make them. ', u'In diets where the body does not get its usual fuel of carbohydrates and fat, protein provides the body energy.', u'The Weight of Water', u'Two-thirds of your body is made up of water. Without it, you could only live a few days. The fluid helps control ', u'body temperature', u'intestines', u", and greases the joints. It's also an essential ingredient in the production of energy molecules.", u'Continued', u'"', u'Dehydration', u"Everyone's water needs vary. In February 2004, the Institute of Medicine released a report indicating most people meet their daily ", u'hydration', u'To adequately get your ', u'hydration', u'Water is especially important after ', u'exercise', u', with certain medicines, and with a high-fiber diet. Your fluid intake should be adjusted to how much water you\'re losing, says Finley. "A simple thing like stopping at a drinking fountain when you walk by one is a good idea."', u'Caffeine Fix', u'More than half of Americans reach for a coffee cup every day, and 25% drink it occasionally, reports the National Coffee Association. This should come as no surprise as there are those who swear they cannot function without the ', u'caffeine', u'.', u'The compound can be found not only in coffee but in tea, soft drinks, ', u'chocolate', u', and herbs as well.', u'John Allred, PhD, a food science communicator for the Institute of Food Technologists, says stimulants like ', u'caffeine', u'heart', u'Psychology', u'caffeine', u'headaches', u'Continued', u'The effect of caffeine varies from person to person. Some people need a few cups before experiencing stimulation; others feel shaky or jittery with one serving.', u'Caffeine can also interfere with ', u'sleep', u", particularly if it is consumed in the late afternoon. The lack of shuteye could obviously affect one's energy level. To resolve this issue, Camire recommends switching to decaffeinated beverages by about 3 p.m. She also suggests gradually cutting back on caffeinated drinks, especially since they may have a dehydrating effect.", u'Beating the Doldrums', u"Food can raise or diminish your body's energy levels. If you are eating healthy and are still tired, try changing the frequency of your meals. Some people find they get more of a boost with several small meals throughout the day, while others prefer the concept of three square meals daily. There's no right or wrong way, says Sandquist, noting that everyone's energy needs differ.", u'The amount of food you eat can also make a difference. If someone overeats constantly, he or she tends to gain more ', u'weight', u'overweight', u', they have less energy, and then they ', u'exercise', u'Other dietary reasons for ', u'fatigue', u'vitamins', u'If you still find yourself sluggish with a well-balanced diet, then a visit to the doctor may be in order.
