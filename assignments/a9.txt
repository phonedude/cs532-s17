Assignment #9
Due: 11:59pm May 1 2017

Support your answer: include all relevant discussion, assumptions,
examples, etc.

1.  Choose a blog or a newsfeed (or something similar with an Atom
or RSS feed).  Every student should do a unique feed, so please
"claim" the feed on the class email list (first come, first served).
It should be on a topic or topics of which you are qualified to
provide classification training data.  Find something with at least
100 entries (or items if RSS).

Create between four and eight different categories for the entries
in the feed:

examples: 

work, class, family, news, deals

liberal, conservative, moderate, libertarian

sports, local, financial, national, international, entertainment

metal, electronic, ambient, folk, hip-hop, pop

Download and process the pages of the feed as per the week 12 
class slides.

Be sure to upload the raw data (Atom or RSS) to your github account.

Create a table with 100 rows, like:

title			classification
-----			--------------
Ric Ocasek -		80s 
"Something To Grab 
For" (forgotten song)	

Weezer - "Pinkerton" 	alternative
(LP Review)

Schon & Hammer - 	80s
"No More Lies" 
(forgotten song)

etc.  This is your "ground truth" (or "gold standard") data.

2.  Train the Fisher classifier on the first 50 entries (the "training
set"), then use the classifier to guess the classification of the
next 50 entries (the "test set").

Create a table with 50 rows, like

title			actual		predicted
-----			------		---------
Donnie Iris - 		80s		80s
"Ah! Leah!" 
(Forgotten Song)	

Black Sabbath - 	metal		metal
"Vol. 4" (LP Review)

Catherine Wheel - 	alternative	metal
"Ferment" (LP Review)

Assess the performance of your classifier in each of your categories
by computing precision, recall, and F-measure.  Use the "macro-averaged"
label based method, as per:

http://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/21551/how-to-compute-precision-recall-for-multiclass-multilabel-classification

For example, if you have 5 categories (e.g., 80s, metal,
alternative, electronic, cover), you will compute 
precision, recall, and F-measure for each category,
and then compute the average across the 5 categories.

3.  Repeat question #2, but use the first 90 entries to train your
classifier and the last 10 entries for testing.

4.  Rerun question 3, but with "10-fold cross validation".  What
was the change, if any, in precision and recall (and thus F-Measure)?
