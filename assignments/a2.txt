Assignment #2
Due: 11:59pm February 9

1.  Write a Python program that extracts 1000 unique links from
Twitter.  You might want to take a look at:

http://adilmoujahid.com/posts/2014/07/twitter-analytics/

see also:

http://docs.tweepy.org/en/v3.5.0/index.html
https://github.com/bear/python-twitter
https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public

But there are many other similar resources available on the web.
Note that only Twitter API 1.1 is currently available; version 1
code will no longer work.

Also note that you need to verify that the final target URI (i.e.,
the one that responds with a 200) is unique.  You could have many
different shortened URIs for www.cnn.com (t.co, bit.ly, goo.gl,
etc.).  For example:

$ curl -IL --silent https://t.co/DpO767Md1v | egrep -i "(HTTP/1.1|^location:)"
HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
location: https://goo.gl/40yQo2
HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
Location: https://soundcloud.com/roanoketimes/ep-95-talking-hokies-recruiting-one-week-before-signing-day
HTTP/1.1 200 OK

You might want to use the search feature to find URIs, or you can
pull them from the feed of someone famous (e.g., Tim O'Reilly).  If
you find something inappropriate for any reason you see fit, just
discard it and get some more links.  We just want 1000 links that
were shared via Twitter.

Hold on to this collection and upload it to github -- we'll use it
later throughout the semester.

2.  Download the TimeMaps for each of the target URIs.  We'll use the ODU 
Memento Aggregator, so for example:

URI-R = http://www.cs.odu.edu/

URI-T = http://memgator.cs.odu.edu/timemap/link/http://www.cs.odu.edu/

or:

URI-T = http://memgator.cs.odu.edu/timemap/json/http://www.cs.odu.edu/

(depending on which format you'd prefer to parse)

Create a histogram* of URIs vs. number of Mementos (as computed
from the TimeMaps).  For example, 100 URIs with 0 Mementos, 300
URIs with 1 Memento, 400 URIs with 2 Mementos, etc.  The x-axis
will have the number of mementos, and the y-axis will have the
frequency of occurence.

What's a TimeMap?  
See: http://www.mementoweb.org/guide/quick-intro/
And the week 4 lecture.  

3.  Estimate the age of each of the 1000 URIs using the "Carbon
Date" tool:

http://ws-dl.blogspot.com/2016/09/2016-09-20-carbon-dating-web-version-30.html

Note: you should use "docker" and install it locally.  You can do
it like this:

http://cd.cs.odu.edu/cd?url=http://www.cs.odu.edu/

But it will inevitably crash when everyone tries to use it at the
last minute.

For URIs that have > 0 Mementos and an estimated creation date,
create a graph with age (in days) on the x-axis and number of
mementos on the y-axis.

Not all URIs will have Mementos, and not all URIs will have an
estimated creation date.  Show how many fall into either categories.
For example,

total URIs:	        1000
no mementos:	 	 137  
no date estimate:	 212
