', u'Quarterly numbers from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) show that the uninsured rate fell to 8.6 percent during the first three months of 2016. That\u2019s the lowest rate the government has on record.', u'Vox / Sarah Frostenson', u'The NCHS data shows states that chose to expand Medicaid programs have cut their uninsured rate in half, while states that opted out of Medicaid expansion programs have not seen as dramatic of a decline.', u'It also finds that more and more Americans are enrolled in high-deductible insurance plans \u2014 and those with the highest uninsured rates are young adults between the ages of 25 and 34.', u'States that expanded Medicaid coverage cut their uninsured rate in half', u'States that opted to expand Medicaid coverage to include lower-income individuals have managed to cut their uninsured rate from 18.4 percent in 2013 to 9.2 percent in the first three months of 2016.', u'But for the ', u'19 states', u'Adults in states with an insurance marketplace managed by the federal government were also more likely to be uninsured than those individuals living in states with a state-based marketplace.', u'The number of Americans seeking private health coverage is increasing, but not in the marketplace', u'Of the 178.5 million Americans covered by private health insurance, 10.8 million, or 4 percent, are currently covered by private plans obtained through the Obamacare marketplaces.

Forty percent of people under the age of 45 with private health insurance were enrolled in an HDHP, compared with 36.7 percent in 2015.
