It\u2019s thanks to a scented candle presented by the old queen of pop to the new, after Swift commented on the aroma of Madge\u2019s own chambers. \u201cBut hers has a hint of eucalyptus mist, too,\u201d says Taylor. \u201cI don\u2019t have the wherewithal to work a steamer \u2013 it seems very complex.\u201d', u'As we speak, a display of alien-looking purple flowers arrives from Mary J Blige. Also delivered this morning was a presentation box of M&M\u2019s imprinted with the images of Swift\u2019s two cats. \u201cI am freaking out about them,\u201d she says, zipping across the room. \u201cI sent pictures to all my friends.\u201d She plops back down on the sofa. \u201cSo\u2026 that\u2019s my dressing room vibe!\u201d', u'We\u2019re backstage at the 1989 Tour, the blockbuster arena spectacular in support of Swift\u2019s world-beating album of the same name. This is the fourth of an unprecedented five sold-out nights at LA\u2019s Staples Center, and Swift is loving every minute. \u201cI was thinking about this yesterday and it hit me: I don\u2019t want this tour to end. Ever,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd that\u2019s never happened to me before.\u201d', u'Part of the fun of the 1989 Tour is its revolving cast of surprise special guests. Last night, Alanis Morissette joined her to sing angsty 1995 hit \u2018You Oughta Know\u2019, and comedian Ellen DeGeneres walked the catwalk dressed as what Swift describes as \u201ca disco ball ballerina\u201d. The guests keep things fresh where nerves no longer do. \u201cI [only] get nervous for TV or any situation in which I feel there are people in the audience who hate me,\u201d she says, hugging her legs to her chest. \u201cIf there are a considerable amount of people in the first couple of rows who I know are wishing I would trip and fall onstage, that stresses me out. So not at my shows. Maybe an awards show or something\u2026\u201d ', u'Swift has, as she puts it, \u201chad a lot of very\u2026 off the wall things happen\u201d at awards shows, whether going home with so many trophies you feel embarrassed for the other performers or being interrupted on stage at 2009\u2019s MTV VMAs, when Kanye West decided Swift\u2019s Best Female Video nod was an insult to Beyonc\xe9. \u201cI\u2019m one of the few [to have experienced that] \u2013 and the other one is in the next dressing room,\u201d she says, gesturing towards the wall. \u201cDid you know Beck\u2019s here?\u201d', u'Singer-songwriter Beck, target of West\u2019s ire at this year\u2019s Grammys, is tonight\u2019s guest performer. So is this some kind of survivors club? \u201cNo, me and Kanye are on such good terms now, six years later,\u201d says Swift. \u201cIt took a while\u2026 But I had to tell Beck this story earlier. I was at dinner with Kanye a week after the Grammys, he stops what he\u2019s saying and he goes, \u2018What is this song? I need to listen to this every day.\u2019 I say, \u2018It\u2019s Beck, it\u2019s on an album called \u2018Morning Phase\u2019, I think you\u2019ve heard of it\u2026\u2019 We just burst out laughing. And he says, \u2018Hey, sometimes I\u2019m wrong.\u2019\u201d', u'Looming over the weekend, this year\u2019s VMAs pose their own threat, following a back-and-forth with rapper Nicki Minaj. Affronted at not being nominated for her own \u2018Anaconda\u2019 video, Minaj tweeted, \u201cIf your video celebrates women with very slim bodies, you will be nominated for vid of the year.\u201d Swift took this as a swipe at her own supermodel-tastic \u2018Bad Blood\u2019 video and tweeted back, setting in motion a two-day media feeding frenzy in which everyone from Katy Perry (Team Nicki) to Ed Sheeran (Team Taylor) waded in and, at its conclusion, Swift issued an earnest apology to Minaj. ', u'So that\u2019s going to be awkward, right? Swift exhales deeply. \u201cIt\u2019s not any person in particular or any situation that makes me feel nervous about the VMAs, it\u2019s that I don\u2019t know what to be nervous about.\u201d How did she feel when it started blowing up? \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about it,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I send text messages now. If there seems to be some kind of misunderstanding, I go to someone\u2019s management, I get their number and I text them. It\u2019s an important lesson for anyone to learn in 2015.\u201d', u'Taylor Swift is experiencing a funny kind of fame. Her album \u20181989\u2019 is a cultural milestone, a new generation\u2019s answer to \u2018Thriller\u2019. While that album\u2019s mega-success set Michael Jackson on course for a peculiar life, he arguably had an easier ride than Swift. She lives in a world in which her every word, move, outfit and Instagram post is dissected in real time. \u201cI\u2019m in the news every single day for multiple different reasons,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd it can feel, at times, if you let your anxiety get the better of you, like everybody\u2019s waiting for you to really mess up \u2013 and then you\u2019ll be done. A lot of the time I need to call my mom and talk for a really long time, just to remind myself of all the things that are great and all the things that matter. If you do something that defines your character to be not what the public thought you were, that\u2019s the biggest risk.\u201d', u'The question is, what do the public think of Taylor Swift? The brilliant, fizzy 2014 single \u2018Shake It Off\u2019 spoke of tutting hordes \u2013 \u201cThey say I stay out too late, go on too many dates\u201d \u2013 but Swift is the opposite. The luminous glare of public attention has challenged pop stars to go further and further to shock: weed smoking, body part-flashing \u2013 none of it means anything any more. Taylor is the opposite. She has an enviable coterie of high-achieving female friends, among them models, writers, singers and actresses. She dresses immaculately. She doesn\u2019t swear at all in an hour\u2019s conversation. She sells perfection, and that\u2019s the most difficult look to sustain. Miley and Rihanna don\u2019t claim to be role models. Taylor does. ', u'\u201cIt\u2019s not about trying to be perfect,\u201d she insists. \u201cNot to try and sound like the good witch in The Wizard Of Oz or something, but I really do want to do good things with what I have, and that\u2019s it. I don\u2019t think my brain could cook up very shocking things for the sake of being shocking.\u201d', u'Recently, Swift\u2019s been flexing her business muscle, personally taking on first Spotify and then Apple, who she called out for not paying royalties to artists in the trial period of Apple Music. Astonishingly, Apple\u2019s Senior VP Eddy Cue capitulated to Swift\u2019s will the very next day. You\u2019d call it a David & Goliath battle but first you\u2019d have to decide which is which. Swift is the archetypal tall poppy and the shears are already out, from gossip websites questioning the hierarchy of her friend \u2018squad\u2019 to a viral video in which comedian Lara Marie Schoenhals plays a bubbly Swift introducing the Salem witches and \u201cthe fabulous 51 victims of Bill Cosby\u201d to the stage. ', u'If there\u2019s a backlash brewing, Swift intends to \u2013 well \u2013 shake it off. \u201cThere\u2019s really nothing I can do about it, because I\u2019m living my life the way I want to live it,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you want to be snarky about me sharing my stage with other artists and giving these fans \u2013 who\u2019ve paid their own money to see a show \u2013 more than they expected to see that night, if you\u2019d like to be snarky about that, then go ahead.\u201d', u'Swift seems preternaturally well adjusted for a 25-year-old operating under such intense scrutiny, but she\u2019s far from her first flurry of success. Having moved her family from Pennsylvania to Nashville, she signed to RCA Records at 14 and tapped into an under-served market of teenage country music fans. \u201cIn 10 years of touring and writing albums, and having my confessional songwriting misunderstood, misconstrued, paraphrased, investigated, I\u2019ve never wavered. This is the way I want to live my life,\u201d she says. Does she ever think about the things she\u2019s lost in her pursuit of a music career? She looks back incredulously. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing I would change about my life!\u201d You wouldn\u2019t like to be able to walk down the street unnoticed? ', u'\u201cNah! I want to play stadiums.\u201d She extends both hands as if weighing the options. \u201cPlaying stadiums\u2026 walking down the street\u2026 I\u2019d choose playing stadiums. It\u2019s a trade-off. There\u2019s no way to travel two roads at once. You pick one. And if you don\u2019t like the road you\u2019re on, you change direction. You don\u2019t sit there and go, \u2018Oh, I wish I could have all the good things in the world and none of the bad things.\u2019 It doesn\u2019t work like that.\u201d', u'If Swift has a dark side, it doesn\u2019t surface during NME\u2019s eight hours being escorted around the Staples Center. First, she\u2019s goofing around during the soundcheck with Beck and St Vincent, whose guitar playing she enjoys so much she hoots, \u201cI need more of that in my life!\u201d Soon after, Swift is in full uniform \u2013 high heels, slip dress and hazard red lips \u2013 for the first of many meet-and-greet sessions, which take place in a mini museum containing costumes in glass cases. On the way in, Swift bowls over with an update. \u201cI just heard John Legend is coming tonight so I called Chrissy [Teigen, Legend\u2019s wife] to see if he\u2019d sing \u2018All Of Me\u2019 with me,\u201d she says, breathlessly. \u201cHe\u2019s going to do it. No rehearsal! No pressure!\u201d She pulls a face of exaggerated, excited worry. ', u'The show itself is phenomenal. There are killer songs. There are costume changes. There\u2019s a catwalk that rises up and swings around so Swift can serenade each section of the audience. The fans, in turn, show undying devotion. ', u'One holds up a placard that says \u2018Taylor Is Life\u2019. When John Legend does come out, #AllOfMe starts trending on Twitter.', u'The next night sees more guest stars (Justin Timberlake, gal pal Selena Gomez, Friends\u2019 Lisa Kudrow) and the conclusion of the LA run. That weekend at the VMAs, Swift sings with Nicki Minaj, Minaj turns her attention on Miley Cyrus, Cyrus\u2019 errant nipple dominates headlines and Taylor\u2019s new video is accused of being a \u201ccolonialist fantasy\u201d in various thinkpieces. Swift doesn\u2019t comment; dignified silence is often the best response. Her life seems exhausting, like one big chess game. But she\u2019s wired for it. After the show, Taylor\u2019s dad is hanging around. I tell him how much I enjoyed the show. \u201cSure,\u201d he says, \u201cBut who\u2019s having the most fun? Taylor is. As always.\u201d Dad probably knows best.', u'Latest Videos', u'Blondie \u2013 Soundtrack Of My Life', u'Kurt at 50: the Nirvana frontman\u2019s 7 wisest quotes', u'The 2017 VO5 NME Awards \u2013 All The Highlights From This Year\u2019s Show', u'A day in London with Marshmello \u2013 NME: Under The Skin', u'Louis Theroux wins Best Film at the 2017 VO5 NME Awards', u'Sadiq Khan on saving London\u2019s night life \u2013 VO5 NME Awards 2017', u'NME Merch', u"MIA Uniting People Since 2003 World Black Women's Vest", u'\xa3', u'14.95', u'Buy now', u'Frank Zappa Freak Out Logo T-Shirt', u'\xa3', u'14.95', u'Buy now', u"Game Of Thrones All Men Must Die Women's T-Shirt", u'\xa3', u'14.95', u'Buy now', u"Captain America Civil War 'A' Game Steel Blue T-Shirt", u'\xa3', u'14.95', u'Buy now', u"Disney Minnie Mouse Password Black Women's T-Shirt", u'\xa3', u'14.95', u'Buy now', u"Muppets Animal Men's T-Shirt", u'\xa3', u'14.95', u'Buy now', u"This Week's Magazine", u'Exclusive Interview With NME\u2019s 2017 Godlike Geniuses Pet Shop Boys', u'Connect With Us', u'NME Newsletter', u'Your email address:', u'Go', u'By submitting your details, you will also receive emails from ', u'Time Inc.
