They don\'t kill you the easy way if you worked as an interpreter. They will try every maniac punishment first to hurt you," he said.', u"Interpreters coming new to the US have all big dreams, and think that this is the end of my trouble, I'll have a better life, but I think it's the start of another big trouble.

That we still survived ... by chance. I mean we can take\xa0precautions, we can take security measures, but for how long?" says Wahdat.', u'Weeks after we met Wahdat in Afghanistan in the spring of 2016, officials from the US government contacted us to ask for more information about his case. A month later, his visa was approved.', u'"I still remember, it was May 12, 2016, at 02:32 o\'clock. I was at the top of the roof and I checked it, I just yelled and I started running to my mom, jumping up and down and said, here is my visa it\'s approved and it\u2019s issued.
