I know it\u2019s the height of election season, and I happen to have a day job that keeps me pretty busy. But given the chance to immerse myself in the possibility of interplanetary travel or join a deep-dive conversation on artificial intelligence, I\u2019m going to say yes. I love this stuff. Always have. It\u2019s why my favorite movie of last year was ', u'The\xa0Martian', u'. Of course, I\u2019m predisposed to love any movie where Americans defy the odds and inspire the world. But what really grabbed me about the film is that it shows how humans\u2014through our ingenuity, our commitment to fact and reason, and ultimately our faith in each other\u2014can science the heck out of just about any problem. ', u'I\u2019m a guy who grew up watching ', u'Star Trek', u'\u2014and I\u2019d be lying if I said that show didn\u2019t have at least some small influence on my worldview. What I loved about it was its optimism, the fundamental belief at its core that the people on this planet, for all our varied backgrounds and outward differ\xadences, could come together to build a better tomorrow.', u'I still believe that. I believe we can work together to do big things that raise the fortunes of people here at home and all over the world. And even if we\u2019ve got some work left to do on faster-than-light travel, I still believe science and technology is the warp drive that accelerates that kind of change for everybody.', u'Here\u2019s another thing I believe: We are far better equipped to take on the challenges we face than ever before. I know that might sound at odds with what we see and hear these days in the cacophony of cable news and social media. But the next time you\u2019re bombarded with over-the-top claims about how our country is doomed or the world is coming apart at the seams, brush off the cynics and fearmongers. Because the truth is, if you had to choose any time in the course of human history to be alive, you\u2019d choose this one. Right here in America, right now.', u'President Barack Obama, photographed in the Old Family Dining Room of the White House on August 24, 2016.', u'Christopher Anderson/Magnum Photos', u'Let\u2019s start with the big picture. By almost every measure, this country is better, and the world is better, than it was 50 years ago, 30 years ago, or even eight years ago. Leave aside the sepia tones of the 1950s, a time when women, minorities, and \xadpeople with disabilities were shut out of huge parts of American life. Just since 1983, when I finished college, things like crime rates, teen pregnancy rates, and poverty rates are all down. Life expectancy is up. The share of Americans with a college education is up too. Tens of mil\xadlions of Americans recently gained the security of health insurance. Blacks and Latinos have risen up the ranks to lead our businesses and communities. Women are a larger part of our workforce and are earning more money. Once-quiet factories are alive again, with assembly lines churning out the components of a clean-energy age.', u'And just as America has gotten better, so has the world. More countries know democracy. More kids are going to school. A smaller share of humans know chronic hunger or live in extreme poverty. In nearly two dozen countries\u2014including our own\u2014\xadpeople now have the freedom to marry whomever they love. And last year the nations of the world joined together to forge the most comprehen\xadsive agreement to battle climate change in human history.', u'This kind of progress hasn\u2019t happened on its own. It happened because people organized and voted for better prospects; because leaders enacted smart, forward-\xadlooking policies; because people\u2019s perspectives opened up, and with them, societies did too. But this progress also happened because we scienced the heck out of our challenges. Science is how we were able to combat acid rain and the AIDS epidemic. Technology is what allowed us to communicate across oceans and empathize with one another when a wall came down in Berlin or a TV personality came out. Without Norman Borlaug\u2019s wheat, we could not feed the world\u2019s hungry. Without Grace Hopper\u2019s code, we might still be analyzing data with pencil and paper.', u'That\u2019s one reason why I\u2019m so optimistic about the future: the constant churn of scientific progress. Think about the changes we\u2019ve seen just during my presidency. When I came into office, I broke new ground by pecking away at a Black\xadBerry. Today I read my briefings on an iPad and explore national parks through a virtual-\xadreality headset. Who knows what kind of changes are in store for our next president and the ones who follow?', u'Ben Wiseman', u'That\u2019s why I centered this issue on the idea of frontiers\u2014stories and ideas about what\u2019s over the next horizon, about what lies on the other side of the barriers we haven\u2019t broken through yet. I wanted to explore how we get past where we are today to build a world that\u2019s even better for us all\u2014as individuals, as communities, as a country, and as a planet.', u'Because the truth is, while we\u2019ve made great progress, there\u2019s no shortage of challenges ahead: Climate change. Economic inequality. Cybersecurity. Terrorism and gun violence. Cancer, Alzheimer\u2019s, and \xadantibiotic-resistant superbugs. Just as in the past, to clear these hurdles we\u2019re\xa0going to need everyone\u2014policy makers and commu\xadnity leaders, teachers and workers and grassroots activists, presidents and soon-to-be-former presidents. And to accelerate that change, we need science. We need researchers and academics and engineers; programmers, surgeons, and botanists. And most important, we need not only the folks at MIT or Stanford or the NIH but also the mom in West Virginia tinkering with a 3-D printer, the girl on the South Side of Chicago learning to code, the dreamer in San Antonio seeking investors for his new app, the dad in North Dakota learning new skills so he can help lead the green revolution.', u'That\u2019s how we will overcome the challenges we face: by unleashing the power ', u'o', u'f', u'for', u'Related Stories', u'Issie Lapowsky', u'Obama: \u201cWe Don\u2019t Fear the Future\u2014We Shape It\u201d', u'James West', u'The Pope, Obama, and China\u2019s President Want to Save Earth', u'Issie Lapowsky', u'The Success of Obama\u2019s Gun Plan Boils Down to Better Tech and More Data', u'The point is, we need today\u2019s big thinkers thinking big. Think like you did when you were watching ', u'Star Trek', u'Star Wars', u'Inspector Gadget', u'. Think like the kids I meet every year at the White House Science Fair. We started this event in 2010 with a \xadsimple premise: We need to teach our kids that it\u2019s not just the winner of the Super Bowl who deserves to be celebrated but the winner of the science fair. Since then, I\u2019ve met young people who are tackling everything from destroying cancer cells to using algae to produce clean energy to distributing vaccines to remote areas of the world\u2014all before most of them can even vote.', u'And as I meet with these young \xadpeople, I can\u2019t help but wonder what might be next\u2014what might happen at a White House Science Fair in five years or 20 years or 50 years? I imagine a student who grows an artificial pancreas right in front of the president\u2014an idea that eventually eliminates waiting lists for lifesaving organs. I imagine the girls who discover a new fuel based on only sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide; the teenager who makes voting and civic activism as addictive as scrolling through your Twitter feed; the boy from Idaho who grows potatoes from a plot of soil brought back from our colony on Mars. And I imagine some future president strolling out on the South Lawn with a student who invented a new kind of telescope. As the president looks through the lens, the girl turns the telescope to a planet she just discovered, orbiting a faraway star at the very edge of our galaxy. Then she says she\u2019s hard at work on another invention\u2014one that will take us there someday.', u'These kinds of moments are closer than you think. My hope is that these kids\u2014maybe some of your kids or grandkids\u2014will be even more curious and creative and confident than we are today. But that depends on us. We must continue to nurture our children\u2019s curiosity. We must keep funding scientific, technological, and medical research. And above all, we must embrace that quintes\xadsentially American compulsion to race for new frontiers and push the bound\xadaries of what\u2019s possible. If we do, I\u2019m hopeful that tomorrow\u2019s Americans will be able to look back at what we did\u2014the diseases we conquered, the social problems we solved, the planet we protected for them\u2014and when they see all that, they\u2019ll plainly see that ', u'theirs', u'This article appears in the November 2016 issue.
