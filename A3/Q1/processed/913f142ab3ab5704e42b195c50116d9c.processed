But when it's out of control\x97as in rheumatoid arthritis\x97it can damage the body. Plus, it's thought to play a role in obesity, heart disease, and cancer. ", u'Foods high in sugar and saturated fat can spur inflammation. \u201cThey cause overactivity in the immune system, which can lead to joint pain, fatigue, and damage to the blood vessels,\u201d says Scott Zashin, MD, clinical professor at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas.', u'Other foods may curb inflammation. Add these items to your plate today.', u'View all ', u'Photo: Getty Images\n', u'Fatty fish\n', u'Oily fish, like salmon, mackerel, tuna and sardines, are high in omega-3 fatty acids, which have been shown to help reduce inflammation. To get the benefits, however, you need to eat fish several times a week, and it should be cooked in healthy ways: In a 2009 study from the University of Hawaii, men who ate baked or boiled fish (as opposed to fried, dried, or salted) cut their risk of heart disease by 23% compared to those who ate the least. ', u'Not a fan of fish? Consider fish-oil supplements. They can cut inflammation, although a 2013 study found that if a diet is too high in omega-6 fatty acids (found in processed foods and vegetable oil), fish-oil supplements may spur inflammation.', u'View all ', u'Photo: Getty Images\n', u'Whole grains\n', u'Consuming most of your grains as whole grains, as opposed to refined, white bread, cereal, rice, and pasta can help keep harmful inflammation at bay. That\u2019s because whole grains have more fiber, which has been shown to ', u'reduce levels of C-reactive protein', u', a marker of inflammation in the blood, and they usually have less added sugar. ', u'But a 2013 Harvard study found that not all products labeled \u201cwhole grain\u201d are much healthier than their refined counterparts. To be sure you\u2019re getting the benefits, look for foods with a whole grain as the first ingredient, and no added sugars.', u'View all ', u'Photo: Getty Images\n', u'Dark leafy greens\n', u'Studies have suggested that vitamin E may play a key role in protecting the body from pro-inflammatory molecules called cytokines\x97and one of the best sources of this vitamin is dark green veggies, such as spinach, kale, broccoli, and collard greens. Dark greens and cruciferous vegetables also tend to have higher concentrations of vitamins and minerals\x97like calcium, iron, and disease-fighting phytochemicals\x97than those with lighter-colored leaves.', u'View all ', u'Photo: Getty Images\n', u'Nuts\n', u'Another source of inflammation-fighting healthy fats is nuts\x97particularly almonds, which are rich in fiber, calcium, and vitamin E, and walnuts, which have high amounts of alpha-linolenic acid, a type of omega-3 fat. All nuts, though, are packed with antioxidants, which can help your body fight off and repair the damage caused by inflammation. Nuts (along with fish, leafy greens, and whole grains) are a big part of the Mediterranean diet, which has been shown to reduce inflammation in as little as six weeks.', u'View all ', u'Photo: Getty Images\n', u'Soy\n', u'Several studies have suggested that isoflavones, estrogen-like compounds found in soy products, may help lower CRP and inflammation levels in women\x97and a 2007 animal study published in the ', u'Journal of Inflammation', u'Avoid heavily-processed soy whenever possible, which may not include the same benefits and is usually paired with additives and preservatives. Instead, aim to get more soy milk, tofu, and edamame (boiled soybeans) into your regular diet.', u'View all ', u'Photo: Getty Images\n', u'Low-fat dairy\n', u'Milk products are sometimes considered a trigger food for inflammatory diseases like rheumatoid arthritis, because some people have allergies or intolerances to casein, the protein found in dairy. But for people who can tolerate it, low-fat and nonfat milk are an important source of nutrients. Yogurt can also contain probiotics, which can reduce gut inflammation. ', u'\u201cFoods with calcium and vitamin D, such as yogurt and skim milk, are good for everyone,\u201d says Karen H. Costenbader, MD, associate professor of medicine and rheumatoid arthritis doctor at Harvard Medical School. In addition to their anti-inflammatory properties, she says, \u201cit is important to get enough calcium and vitamin D for bone strength, and possibly reduction of cancer and other health risks.\u201d', u'View all ', u'Photo: Getty Images\n', u'Peppers\n', u'\u201cColorful vegetables are part of a healthier diet in general,\u201d says Dr. Costenbader. \u201cAs opposed to white potatoes or corn, colorful  peppers, tomatoes, squash, and leafy vegetables have high quantities of antioxidant vitamins and lower levels of starch.\u201d Bell peppers are available in a variety of colors, while hot peppers (like chili and cayenne) are rich in capsaicin, a chemical that\u2019s used in topical creams that reduce pain and inflammation. ', u'Peppers, however, are nightshade vegetables\x97which some doctors and patients believe can exacerbate inflammation in people with rheumatoid arthritis. \u201cWhat helps one person may be harmful to another,\u201d says Dr. Zashin. \u201cYou just need to pay attention to your diet and your symptoms, and stick with what works for you.\u201d', u'View all ', u'Photo: Getty Images\n', u'Tomatoes\n', u'Tomatoes, another nightshade veggie, may also help reduce inflammation in some people. (Of course, Dr. Zashin\u2019s advice about what works for you, individually, applies here, as well.) ', u'Juicy red tomatoes, specifically, are rich in lycopene, which has been shown to reduce inflammation in the lungs and throughout the body. Cooked tomatoes contain even more lycopene than raw ones, so tomato sauce works, too\x97and a ', u'2012 Iranian study', u'View all ', u'Photo: Getty Images\n', u'Beets\n', u'This vegetable\u2019s brilliant red color is a tip-off to its equally brilliant antioxidant properties: Beets (and beetroot juice) have been shown to reduce inflammation, as well as protect against cancer and heart disease, thanks to their hearty helping of fiber, vitamin C and plant pigments called betalains.', u'View all ', u'Photo: Getty Images\n', u'Ginger and turmeric\n', u'These spices, common in Asian and Indian cooking, have been shown in various studies to have anti-inflammatory properties. \u201cWhile the evidence in terms of RA inflammation is not very strong, they are vegetables\x97and part of a healthy, vegetable-rich diet,\u201d says Dr. Costenbader.', u'Turmeric, the ingredient that gives curry its yellow color, works in the body by helping to turn off a NF-kappa B, a protein that regulates the immune system and triggers the process of inflammation, researchers say. Its relative ginger, meanwhile, has been shown to reduce inflammation in the intestines when taken in supplement form.', u'View all ', u'Photo: Getty Images\n', u'Garlic and onions\n', u'There\u2019s a good reason why these pungent vegetables are known for their immunity-boosting properties. In test-tube and animal studies, garlic has been shown to work similarly to NSAID pain medications (like ibuprofen), shutting off the pathways that lead to inflammation. Onions contain similar anti-inflammatory chemicals, including the phytonutrient quercetin and the compound allicin, which breaks down to produce free radical-fighting sulfenic acid.', u'View all ', u'Photo: Getty Images\n', u'Olive oil\n', u'\u201cAnything that fits into a heart-healthy diet is probably also good for inflammation\x97and that includes healthy, plant-based fats like olive oil,\u201d says Dr. Zashin, author of ', u'Natural Arthritis Treatment', u'amazon.com', u'). In fact, a 2010 Spanish study found that the Mediterranean diet\u2019s myriad health benefits may be largely due to its liberal use of olive oil, especially the extra-virgin kind. The compound oleocanthal, which gives olive oil its taste, has been shown to have a similar effect as NSAID painkillers in the body.', u'View all ', u'Photo: Getty Images\n', u'Berries\n', u'All fruits can help fight inflammation, because they\u2019re low in fat and calories and high in antioxidants. But berries, especially, have been shown to have anti-inflammatory properties\x97possibly because of anthocyanins, the powerful chemicals that gives them their rich color.', u'Studies have shown, for example, that red raspberry extract helped prevent animals from developing arthritis; that blueberries can help protect against intestinal inflammation and ', u'ulcerative colitis', u'; and that women who eat more strawberries have lower levels of CRP in their blood.', u'View all ', u'Photo: Getty Images\n', u'Tart cherries\n', u'In a 2012 presentation, Oregon Health & Science University researchers suggested that tart cherries have the \u201chighest anti-inflammatory content of any food.\u201d Studies have found that tart cherry juice can reduce the inflammation in lab rats\u2019 blood vessels by up to 50%; in humans, meanwhile, it\u2019s been shown to help athletes improve their performance and reduce their use of anti-inflammatory pain meds. ', u'Experts recommend eating 1.5 cups of tart cherries, or drinking 1 cup of tart cherry juice, a day to see similar benefits. And yep, they\u2019ve got to be tart\x97sweet cherries just don\u2019t seem to have the same effects.', u'sponsored stories', u'more from health', u'Rheumatoid Arthritis', u'8 Signs and Symptoms of Rheumatoid Arthritis\r\n', u'Food', u'17 Superfoods That Fight Disease\r\n', u'Rheumatoid Arthritis', u'Best and Worst Jobs for People in Pain', u'Fitness\r\n', u'Why I Run\r\n', u'trending', u'10 Superfoods for Weight Loss\r\n', u'These Sweet No-Bake Apple Energy Bites Are Loaded With Protein\r\n', u'6 Secrets to Get to Sleep Faster\r\n', u'Jen Widerstrom\u2019s Superset Workout Fast-Tracks Your Toning Goals\r\n', u'The Best Exercise to Sculpt Your Legs', u'7 Numbers You Should Know for Your Heart\r\n', u'This Easy Banana-Nut Oatmeal Helps Your Body Burn Fat\r\n', u'GET Healthy Now', u'News, workouts, recipes, and more.', u'Sign up', u'No Thanks', u'Rheumatoid Arthritis', u'5 Things You Need to Know About Rheumatoid Arthritis', u'Rheumatoid Arthritis', u'FDA Approves Erelzi, a Biosimilar Version of Enbrel, for Rheumatoid Arthritis', u'Rheumatoid Arthritis', u'FDA Calls BS on Spa Industry\u2019s Cryotherapy Claims', u'Rheumatoid Arthritis', u'Rheumatoid Arthritis Diet Tips', u'Rheumatoid Arthritis', u'8 Signs and Symptoms of Rheumatoid Arthritis', u'Rheumatoid Arthritis', u'10 Ways Rheumatoid Arthritis Affects the Body', u'Rheumatoid Arthritis', u'10 Ways to Ease Rheumatoid Arthritis Pain', u'Rheumatoid Arthritis', u"Arthritis Pain?
